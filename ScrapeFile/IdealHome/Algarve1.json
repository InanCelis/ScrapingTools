    "property_description": "This beautifully renovated two-storey semi-detached townhouse is located in the heart of the picturesque village of Guia, in the municipality of Albufeira. Set on a 75 m² plot with a private gross area of 110.75 m², the property has undergone a complete transformation by a highly regarded interior architect, who created a modern and elegant home while maximising space and natural light. Just a short 10-minute drive from the stunning beaches of Albufeira, such as Praia dos Salgados and Praia da Galé, and only five minutes from the Algarve Shopping Centre, which offers a variety of shops, restaurants, cinemas, and supermarkets, the property is ideally situated for both permanent living and holiday rental potential.\n\nGuia is famously known as the birthplace of Portugals iconic Frango Piri-Piri, or spicy grilled chicken, and is home to numerous traditional restaurants that draw visitors from across the Algarve and beyond. This unbeatable location adds strong rental appeal for investors and an authentic lifestyle for residents.\n\nThe property is currently divided into two fully independent apartments, each with a private entrance. The main apartment features an open-plan kitchen that is fully fitted with modern appliances and seamlessly connects with a bright and stylish living and dining area. On the ground floor, there is a spacious ensuite bedroom, while the first floor is dedicated to the master suite, which offers direct access to a large private balcony with excellent sun exposure, equipped with outdoor furniture perfect for relaxing. From the living area, there is also access to a beautifully designed interior patio, ideal for al fresco dining, with a barbecue area, sofas, and a dining table. This unit is fully air-conditioned with new, high-efficiency units and benefits from solar panel water heating, ensuring energy efficiency and lower operating costs. The home is equipped with high-end double-glazed windows and electric shutters for optimal insulation and comfort.\n\nThe second apartment, also fully renovated and modern, includes an open-plan kitchen, dining, and living area that opens onto its own private patio, also designed for outdoor dining and lounging, complete with a barbecue setup. A bathroom is located on the ground floor, while an elegant staircase leads to the large upstairs ensuite bedroom, which is flooded with natural light and features a built-in wardrobe and a modern bathroom with a bathtub. This unit offers the same attention to detail, including quality finishes, electric shutters, double-glazed windows, and tasteful décor.\n\nThe property also offers private parking with the possibility of installing an electric vehicle charging station, further enhancing its appeal for sustainable living. While currently divided into two independent units, the house can easily be converted back into a single-family home if desired, offering flexibility depending on your lifestyle or investment goals. Whether you're looking for a stylish and energy-efficient home in an authentic Algarvian village or seeking an attractive rental income opportunity, this property represents an outstanding choice.\n\nDon't miss this rare chance to own a turnkey home with unique character and modern comfort in one of the Algarve's most desirable and well-connected locations.

Set on a generous plot of 715 m² with a total construction area of 190 m², this home is designed for relaxed Algarve living.\n\nThe villa features three spacious bedrooms, two located on the Ground  floor, and the master bedroom ensuite on the first floor,  plus an additional room with a built-in wardrobe that can serve as either an office or a fourth bedroom. The master bedroom is an ensuite and boasts generous dimensions along with a private balcony overlooking the lush gardens and sparkling swimming pool.\n\nThe property is nestled within a calm and quiet neighbourhood, surrounded by beautifully kept villas and tree-lined, landscaped streets, all maintained by the Albufeira Municipality.\n\nStep outside, and youll find a large private pool surrounded by a manicured lawn, a jacuzzi, and an inviting outdoor BBQ and dining area. The covered terrace, complete with comfortable outdoor sofas and a dining table for six, includes retractable awnings for thermal comfort and shade, taking full advantage of the Algarves all-day sun.\n\nFor energy efficiency, the villa is equipped with solar panels for water heating, warming the pool and jacuzzi even in cooler months, significantly reducing energy consumption. Photovoltaic panels power the house, automatically switching between solar energy during the day and grid power at night, keeping costs low. The property also features double-glazed windows for excellent insulation. Although the official energy certificate is currently rated C, it does not yet reflect these later eco-friendly upgrades.\n\nInside, youll find a modern, generously sized independent kitchen, equipped with top-quality German appliances, with direct access to a patio. The kitchen is separated from the dining and living rooms, where a cosy fireplace awaits for cooler evenings. The home offers a total of three bathrooms.\n\nConveniently located just five minutes from Algarve Shopping, one of the largest malls in the Algarve offering cinemas, restaurants, a supermarket, and various amenities, the villa is also only 20 minutes from the centre of Albufeira and its famous beaches.",
