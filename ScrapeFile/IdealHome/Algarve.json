Set on a 75 m² plot with a private gross area of 110.75 m², the property has undergone a complete transformation by a highly regarded interior architect, who created a modern and elegant home while maximising space and natural light. Just a short 10-minute drive from the stunning beaches of Albufeira, such as Praia dos Salgados and Praia da Galé, and only five minutes from the Algarve Shopping Centre, which offers a variety of shops, restaurants, cinemas, and supermarkets, the property is ideally situated for both permanent living and holiday rental potential.\n\nGuia is famously known as the birthplace of Portugals iconic Frango Piri-Piri, or spicy grilled chicken, and is home to numerous traditional restaurants that draw visitors from across the Algarve and beyond.

With three nine-hole golf courses on site, beautiful beaches and tranquil natural surroundings nearby, you will be able to travel easily whenever you feel in need of a break away and some well deserved rest and relaxation.</p><p>Cleverly designed to comfortably accommodate more than one group of friends or family, the master bedroom has an en-suite bathroom and is situated on the top floor. Providing access to its own small private terrace, here you can find a semblance of peace and touch of privacy from the rest of the property when desired.</p><p>On the ground floor you will find the second bedroom along with the shared bathroom, fully fitted kitchen, living area and separate WC. Outside is a patio area where you can enjoy the beautiful Algarvian sunshine.<br /><br />All fittings and furnishings are to the highest standard with granite work surfaces and quality kitchen appliances. Designed for use all year round, the property is fitted with air-conditioning units that keep it cool in summer and can be switched to warm air in winter with the added benefit of an open fire to make it even cosier.</p><p>The resort offers a clubhouse and restaurant and prides itself on taking a low density approach to development meaning that all properties benefit from lovely open views. The Villages House area within the resort includes a large, shared communal pool with a tropical pool bar with terrace.</p><p>The Eastern Algarve is quieter than the Central Algarve and this property is less than twenty minutes drive from stunning beaches that although sometimes busy in peak season are relatively peaceful at other times of the year. One of the highlights is Praia Verde or &ldquo;Green Beach&rdquo;, so named because it is surrounded by a forest of green pine trees.</p><p>The small town of Castro Marim is less than ten minutes away and boasts a number of historic attractions including the Moorish castle, Castelo de Castro Marim and beautiful church, Igreja Matriz Castro Marim, as well as all of the amenities that you need. Other attractions include walking and bird watching in the nearby Sapal nature reserve, tennis, horse riding, sailing, windsurfing and nipping over to Spain for some lunchtime tapas!</p>",

    "property_title": "3+1 Bedroom Villa with Pool in Guia, Albufeira",
    "property_description": "Located in the mature and beautifully maintained urbanization of Quinta dos Álamos, Guia  Albufeira, this stunning villa offers the perfect balance of comfort, elegance, and sustainability. Set on a generous plot of 715 m² with a total construction area of 190 m², this home is designed for relaxed Algarve living.\n\nThe villa features three spacious bedrooms, two located on the Ground  floor, and the master bedroom ensuite on the first floor,  plus an additional room with a built-in wardrobe that can serve as either an office or a fourth bedroom. The master bedroom is an ensuite and boasts generous dimensions along with a private balcony overlooking the lush gardens and sparkling swimming pool.\n\nThe property is nestled within a calm and quiet neighbourhood, surrounded by beautifully kept villas and tree-lined, landscaped streets, all maintained by the Albufeira Municipality.\n\nStep outside, and youll find a large private pool surrounded by a manicured lawn, a jacuzzi, and an inviting outdoor BBQ and dining area. The covered terrace, complete with comfortable outdoor sofas and a dining table for six, includes retractable awnings for thermal comfort and shade, taking full advantage of the Algarves all-day sun.\n\nFor energy efficiency, the villa is equipped with solar panels for water heating, warming the pool and jacuzzi even in cooler months, significantly reducing energy consumption. Photovoltaic panels power the house, automatically switching between solar energy during the day and grid power at night, keeping costs low. The property also features double-glazed windows for excellent insulation. Although the official energy certificate is currently rated C, it does not yet reflect these later eco-friendly upgrades.\n\nInside, youll find a modern, generously sized independent kitchen, equipped with top-quality German appliances, with direct access to a patio. The kitchen is separated from the dining and living rooms, where a cosy fireplace awaits for cooler evenings. The home offers a total of three bathrooms.\n\nConveniently located just five minutes from Algarve Shopping, one of the largest malls in the Algarve offering cinemas, restaurants, a supermarket, and various amenities, the villa is also only 20 minutes from the centre of Albufeira and its famous beaches.",
