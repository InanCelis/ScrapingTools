Completed in 2023, it is located in one of Istanbul&rsquo;s most vibrant and well-connected areas, yet its position within the project&rsquo;s inner courtyard ensures peace and privacy away from the city&rsquo;s bustle.</p><p>Currently unfurnished, the apartment provides a blank canvas for creating a home that reflects your personal style.</p><h2>Interior Atmosphere &ndash; Clean Lines and Warm Finishes</h2><p>The design emphasizes simplicity and practicality, making it ideal for those who value a modern, low-maintenance lifestyle.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Flooring &amp; Walls:</strong>Light-toned wooden parquet floors bring warmth and work well with any color scheme. The neutral wall paint creates a calm backdrop, ready for personalization with artwork, shelves, or wallpaper.</p></li><li><p><strong>Windows &amp; Doors:</strong>Large windows allow in abundant daylight, making the rooms bright and airy. In the living area, a wide glass door opens to a French balcony, enhancing the sense of space. Dark-toned frames contrast nicely with the light interior finishes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kitchen:</strong>The separate kitchen is a key advantage, especially for those who enjoy cooking. Glossy white cabinets give the space a clean, modern look, while the layout allows for easy installation of built-in appliances. Reflective surfaces amplify natural light, keeping the kitchen bright throughout the day.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ceiling &amp; Mouldings:</strong>White ceilings and generous skirting boards contribute to a neat and well-finished look. Subtle moulding along the ceiling edges adds a touch of elegance.</p></li></ul><h2>Living Here &ndash; Comfort in the Heart of the City</h2><p>Life in this apartment combines the convenience of a central location with the comfort of a well-planned home.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Flexible Decoration:</strong>With its neutral finishes, the apartment is easy to furnish in either a minimalist or a more decorative style. The living room could host a compact sofa and coffee table, while the kitchen balcony connection offers space for a small dining setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Urban Lifestyle:</strong>Living in Taksim 360 means everything is close by&mdash;restaurants, cultural venues, shopping streets&mdash;yet the apartment&rsquo;s orientation towards the courtyard keeps noise to a minimum.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Layout:</strong>The separate kitchen prevents cooking aromas from spreading to the rest of the home, a feature especially appreciated in compact city apartments.</p></li></ul><h2>Who Will Find It Most Appealing?</h2><p>This home will attract buyers and tenants from different walks of life:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Working Professionals:</strong>Quick access to Istanbul&rsquo;s business and creative hubs while enjoying a comfortable home base.</p></li><li><p><strong>Minimalist Home Seekers:</strong>A simple, modern layout that can be furnished without clutter, perfectly suited for those who value open space and clean design.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cultural Enthusiasts:</strong>A location within walking distance of art galleries, music venues, and historical landmarks, paired with the comforts of a modern building.</p></li></ul><h2>Taksim 360</h2><p>Taksim 360 is a landmark redevelopment project that combines contemporary residences with shops, caf&eacute;s, and landscaped communal areas. Being here means living in the heart of Beyoƒülu, with Istiklal Avenue just a short stroll away and public transport connections in every direction.</p><p>From the apartment, you can reach the Bosphorus shoreline in around 15 minutes, enjoy the nightlife and dining of Asmalƒ±mescit, or explore the city&rsquo;s museums and theaters&mdash;all without giving up the calm of a home set away from main street noise.</p><p>This<strong>2 room apartment with a separate kitchen in Taksim 360</strong>offers a rare mix of central location, modern architecture, and the flexibility to make the space truly your own. Whether for personal use or as an investment in Istanbul&rsquo;s ever-demanded rental market, it&rsquo;s a property that combines style, practicality, and a sought-after address.</p></div>",

    "property_title": "Seafront Residence Permit Eligible Apartment in Alanya",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>Seafront Apartment for Sale in Alanya &ndash; Residence Permit Eligible with Castle &amp; Sea Views</h2><p>Let's be honest &ndash; how many times have you scrolled through social media, seen someone's beachfront breakfast photo, and thought \"I need that life\"? Well, here's your chance to stop double-tapping and start living. This stunning<strong>4 room seafront apartment in Alanya, Tosmur</strong>isn't just a property in Turkey; it's your ticket to becoming that person whose Instagram makes everyone else slightly jealous.</p><p>Picture this: you wake up naturally (no more brutal alarm clocks, thank you very much) to Mediterranean sunlight streaming through your windows. Your morning routine? A leisurely stroll to your floor-to-ceiling windows where the turquoise sea greets you like an old friend. And yes, that's Alanya Castle in the distance &ndash; because apparently your new life comes with its own medieval backdrop. Talk about living the dream!</p><p>This isn't your typical apartment viewing where you need to imagine away the previous owner's questionable wallpaper choices. At 160 m&sup2; of pure coastal elegance, this place comes fully furnished with taste that would make interior design magazines weep with joy.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Now, let's talk about that south and southwest orientation &ndash; and no, this isn't boring real estate jargon. This means your home is basically a solar panel for happiness. Golden hour lighting? You've got it from sunrise to sunset. Those moody, perfectly lit selfies? They're happening whether you try or not. Your friends back home dealing with grey skies will be asking for your secret, and you can casually mention, \"Oh, it's just the Mediterranean lifestyle.\"</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Here's where things get really exciting: this area is open for residence permits. Translation? You can actually make this paradise your permanent address. Whether you're a savvy investor who knows a good thing when you see it, or someone ready to trade the daily grind for daily beach walks, this property opens doors &ndash; quite literally &ndash; to your new Turkish adventure.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">And can we talk about the location for a moment? \"Front beach line\" isn't just marketing speak &ndash; it means you could theoretically roll out of bed, stumble outside, and have your toes in Mediterranean sand before your coffee finishes brewing. Your morning commute becomes a beach walk. Your evening entertainment is watching the sunset paint the sky while waves provide the soundtrack.</p><h2>Interior Design &ndash; Classic Mediterranean with a Country Touch</h2><p>The overall design blends<strong>classic Mediterranean charm</strong>with subtle<strong>country-style elements</strong>. Light-colored furniture, cream-toned sofas, wooden textures, and a natural stone fireplace create a warm and inviting atmosphere. The interior palette leans on cream, beige, soft yellow, and olive green&mdash;colors that not only feel timeless but also harmonize with the coastal surroundings.</p><h3>Living Room &ndash; Comfort Framed by Views</h3><p>The living room is designed for both social gatherings and quiet relaxation. Chesterfield-style sofas with rounded arms and button tufting add a note of sophistication. Delicate floral motifs in the upholstery bring a touch of nostalgia without overpowering the space.</p><p>The seating is arranged in a U-shape by the windows, allowing everyone to enjoy conversation while gazing at the endless blue. In one corner, a stone-clad fireplace stands as both a focal point and a practical feature, perfect for cozy winter evenings.</p><p>Curtains combine light cream on the upper panels with olive green on the lower, paired with sheer drapes to frame the large windows and enhance the perception of height. Daylight streams in freely, while classic chandelier lighting offers a soft, ambient glow after sunset.</p><h3>Balconies and Terraces &ndash; Extending the Living Space</h3><p>Generous balconies open directly to the sea, providing the ideal setting for breakfast with the sunrise, leisurely afternoon reading, or sunset dinners. Rattan-style outdoor furniture adds natural texture, with pale yellow cushions that echo the indoor palette.</p><p>One balcony features a small built-in stone barbecue&mdash;an inviting spot for summer evenings with friends and family.</p><h3>Kitchen &ndash; Rustic Warmth with Everyday Functionality</h3><p>The kitchen embraces a warm, rustic style. Light cream cabinetry with framed doors and matte glass inserts pairs beautifully with a classic ceramic backsplash. A round glass dining table with bamboo chairs brings a casual, summer-home feel. The space is highly functional, offering plenty of storage and a relaxed breakfast area.</p><h3>Bedrooms &ndash; Calm and Minimal</h3><p>Bedrooms follow a minimalist approach for restful comfort. Neutral tones and uncluttered layouts allow for personalization. A few decorative updates&mdash;such as new artwork, bed linens, or accent rugs&mdash;could instantly infuse more character while keeping the peaceful vibe intact.</p><h2>Living Experience &ndash; A Home for All Seasons</h2><p>Owning this apartment means living with the sea as your constant backdrop. Mornings begin with coffee on the balcony as fishing boats pass by. Evenings can be spent hosting friends around the barbecue or watching the sunset from the living room.</p><p>In cooler months, the fireplace becomes the heart of the home, offering warmth while waves roll in outside. The interior&rsquo;s classic design ensures it never feels dated, while small modern touches could adapt it easily to personal taste.</p><h2>Location &ndash; Tosmur's Unique Coastal Charm (The Best Kept Secret of Alanya)</h2><p>Here's a little secret that real estate agents don't always shout about: while everyone's fighting over<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">properties in central Alanya</a>, the smart money has been quietly discovering Tosmur. Located just east of the main hustle and bustle, this serene coastal district is like finding a hidden gem that somehow escaped the tourist guidebook frenzy &ndash; and honestly, that's exactly what makes it so special.</p><p>The star of the show here? The magnificent<strong>Dim&ccedil;ay River</strong>, which isn't just another pretty water feature on your Instagram feed. Come summer, this becomes your personal oasis where the temperature drops a blessed few degrees, and suddenly you understand why locals have been keeping this place to themselves. Picture yourself dining at one of the charming riverside restaurants, your feet dangling in cool mountain water while you feast on fresh trout &ndash; yes, this is actually your neighborhood now, not just a weekend getaway.</p><p>But let's talk about those riverside restaurants for a moment, because they're not your typical tourist traps. These family-run establishments have been perfecting their recipes for generations, serving meals on platforms built right over the flowing water. The sound of the river becomes your dinner music, and the natural air conditioning means you can actually enjoy a hot meal without melting. Some places even have those traditional Turkish wooden platforms where you can lounge like royalty after lunch. And for the kids (or the young at heart), there are go-kart tracks that add just the right amount of adrenaline to your lazy river day.</p><p>Now, here's where Tosmur gets really clever about daily living. Forget about those suburban nightmares where you need a car to buy milk. Everything you need for everyday life is within an easy stroll &ndash; supermarkets that stock both Turkish essentials and international favorites, butchers who know their craft, greengrocers bursting with produce so fresh it was probably picked that morning. But the real treat? The bustling Thursday market that transforms the streets into a sensory adventure of fresh produce, warm b&ouml;rek straight from the oven, olives that taste like sunshine, and those random household items you didn't know you needed until you saw them at unbeatable prices.</p><p>The beauty of Tosmur's compact layout means you can literally walk everywhere without breaking a sweat (well, maybe a little sweat &ndash; it is the Mediterranean, after all). Your daily routine becomes a pleasant neighborhood stroll rather than a logistical challenge. But when you do want to venture beyond your peaceful bubble, public buses practically stop at your doorstep, whisking you off to explore other corners of Alanya. Fancy some shopping in Oba? Fifteen minutes. Want to check out the nightlife in Kestel? Twenty minutes. Feel like exploring the newer developments in Cikcilli? Half an hour max. You get the best of both worlds &ndash; tranquil residential living with the entire Alanya region as your extended backyard.</p><p>The dining scene here deserves its own love letter. Family-run restaurants where the grandmother still makes the bread by hand, serving authentic Turkish dishes that would make your Turkish friends nod in approval. But this isn't some isolated village &ndash; you'll also find eateries with European menus for those nights when you're craving something familiar. The best part? Prices that won't make your wallet weep, because you're living where locals eat, not where tour buses stop.</p><p>And for those days when you want to add a touch of adventure to your routine,<strong>Dim Cave</strong>awaits just a short drive up into the Taurus Mountains. This isn't just any cave &ndash; it's one of Turkey's largest public caves, a natural wonder that stays a cool 18&deg;C year-round. Imagine telling friends back home that your weekend plans include exploring underground cathedrals carved by nature over millions of years. The drive up is an adventure in itself, winding through pine forests and mountain villages where time seems to move at a more civilized pace.</p><p>What really sets Tosmur apart is this perfect balance it strikes. You're close enough to central Alanya to enjoy all the amenities and entertainment of a major resort town, yet far enough away to escape the crowds and noise when you want to. You get to live like a local while still having access to everything that made you fall in love with the Turkish Riviera in the first place.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>4 Room Apartment for Sale in Momentum Residence Alanya Center &ndash; Modern Family Living Near the Sea</h2><p>Some homes are built just for summer. Others, like this one in&nbsp;<strong>Momentum Residence</strong>, are designed for families who want to live in Alanya year-round. With 160 m&sup2; of space, four rooms, and a location just 500 meters from the sea, this apartment combines the size of a true family house with the convenience of being in the city center.</p><p>Built with modern materials and smart layouts, it feels more like a spacious city residence than a holiday flat. For buyers seeking comfort, practicality, and investment value, this property represents one of the strongest options in Alanya today.</p><h2>Living Room &ndash; Spacious and Inviting</h2><p>The living room makes an immediate impression with its sense of space. Light-colored marble-effect flooring and recessed spotlights brighten the area, while dark gray furniture with gold-detailed legs introduces a touch of elegance. The look is &ldquo;simple yet stylish&rdquo;&mdash;not overwhelming, but refined.</p><p>A modern wooden TV unit contrasts nicely with the gray-white tones of the room, adding warmth to the otherwise clean palette. The size of the living room is one of its biggest advantages: it easily accommodates large family gatherings, dinner parties, or evenings with friends.</p><h2>Kitchen &ndash; Functional and Modern</h2><p>The kitchen follows an L-shape design, finished in a timeless combination of white and anthracite cabinetry. The marble-pattern dining table pairs with dark velvet chairs, creating a stylish but practical setup.</p><p>For families who plan to live here year-round, the generous storage and workspace make daily cooking easier. The overall feel is modern, practical, and welcoming&mdash;a kitchen you will actually enjoy using every day.</p><h2>Bedrooms &ndash; Privacy and Comfort</h2><p>The&nbsp;<strong>master bedroom</strong>&nbsp;is designed for comfort. Large windows let in natural light, while curved curtain details and wooden accents create a warm, personal atmosphere. The space feels like a private retreat, complete with en-suite potential.</p><p>The second bedroom includes twin beds&mdash;ideal for children or guests. Its straightforward layout appeals especially to families, as it offers ready-to-use functionality. Additional rooms can serve as guest spaces, home offices, or even hobby rooms, depending on the buyer&rsquo;s needs.</p><h2>Balcony &ndash; Views of the City and Mountains</h2><p>The balcony is large and framed with black wrought-iron railings, adding a classic touch of elegance. The view stretches across both the city and the surrounding mountains, giving residents the best of both worlds.</p><p>During the day, it offers freshness and light. At night, city lights create a cozy backdrop for evening dinners or quiet conversations. In Alanya, balconies are often treated like second living rooms, and this one is more than capable of fulfilling that role.</p><h2>General Atmosphere</h2><p>The apartment as a whole embraces the style of a&nbsp;<strong>modern city home</strong>. Gray tones dominate the palette, giving it a serious, urban feel, but wooden accents soften the look and prevent coldness. Materials are chosen for durability, particularly the flooring and kitchen surfaces, ensuring long-term use.</p><p>This is not a holiday-only flat. It is a full-sized, fully functional apartment designed for everyday life.</p><h2>Facilities in Momentum Residence</h2><p>What makes Momentum Residence especially attractive is its wide range of social and leisure facilities, including:</p><ul><li><p>Outdoor and indoor swimming pools</p></li><li><p>Fitness center, sauna, steam room, and jacuzzi</p></li><li><p>Children&rsquo;s pool, playground, and dedicated kids&rsquo; rooms</p></li><li><p>Relaxing room and poolside bar</p></li><li><p>Barbecue pavilion and landscaped green areas</p></li><li><p>Lobby with caretaker and door security</p></li><li><p>24/7 camera surveillance</p></li><li><p>Open car park and generator</p></li></ul><p>The mix of family-friendly and wellness-focused features makes it equally suitable for long-term living and holiday rentals. Parents can enjoy the spa while children play safely, and everyone benefits from the community atmosphere.</p><h2>Who Will Love This Apartment?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Large families</strong>: With 160 m&sup2; and four rooms, it provides the kind of space that is rare in central Alanya.</p></li><li><p><strong>Long-term residents</strong>: Its layout, storage, and facilities are built for everyday living, not just vacations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>: Located in the city center, close to the beach, with extensive amenities&mdash;it has all the hallmarks of high rental potential.</p></li></ul><p>In short, this apartment is not just about summer&mdash;it is about a lifestyle that works all year.</p><h2>Life in Alanya Center</h2><p>Living in Alanya&rsquo;s center means everything is close at hand. Streets are alive with caf&eacute;s, stylish coffee shops, fashion boutiques, and international restaurants. Global brands share space with local markets, creating a lively mix of modern and traditional.</p><p>Historic landmarks like the&nbsp;<strong>Red Tower</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Alanya Castle</strong>, and the ancient shipyard are part of the daily landscape. Shopping is simple: from jewelry stores to electronics and cosmetics, every need is covered.</p><p>Public transport is frequent and convenient. The 101 bus runs along the coast, stopping at all major beaches, while the 202 lines connect to nearby districts like Oba and Tosmur. Taxis are available everywhere. For those who enjoy walking, the&nbsp;<strong>Damlata≈ü Cave, Alanya Cable Car, and Damlata≈ü Beach</strong>&nbsp;are all within easy reach.</p><p>Evenings in the center are lively, with restaurants serving both world cuisine and local dishes, often at surprisingly affordable prices. Alanya&rsquo;s center is not only beautiful but also practical&mdash;a place that never sleeps.</p><h2>Investment Potential</h2><p>Momentum Residence holds strong appeal for investors.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>Seafront 4 Room Apartment for Sale in Tosmur Alanya &ndash; Fully Furnished with Panoramic Views</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">If you've ever wanted to wake up to endless blue views, this place delivers exactly that. This 4-room<strong>beachfront<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/apartments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apartment in Alanya</a></strong>sits right on the Mediterranean coastline in Tosmur area, and it's semi-furnished and ready to go.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The location really is the main selling point here. You're literally on the seafront with a south-west orientation, so you get both sunrise and sunset views. The main balcony has glass enclosure, which means you can enjoy those sea views even when it's not perfect weather outside. Plus, you get nice views of Alanya Castle and the surrounding mountains too.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The apartment is 140 m&sup2; with an open-plan layout that feels quite spacious. The large format floor tiles help make everything look bright and airy. Since it comes fully furnished, you could basically move in with just your suitcase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Whether you're looking for a permanent home, somewhere for holidays, or an investment property, this ticks the boxes. The minimalist interior style is pretty adaptable if you want to change things up later.</p><h2>Interior Design &ndash; Modern Minimalist with Coastal Influence</h2><p>The apartment&rsquo;s design follows a<strong>modern minimalist style</strong>, with clean white walls, understated ceiling details, and concealed spot lighting that adds depth without clutter. Large beige ceramic floor tiles with a glossy finish give the space a contemporary feel while reflecting natural light throughout the day.</p><h3>Open-Plan Living with a View</h3><p>The<strong>American-style kitchen</strong>merges seamlessly with the living area, allowing you to enjoy sea views from almost every angle. This layout enhances social interaction&mdash;guests can relax in the lounge while you prepare meals without feeling disconnected. The kitchen itself features warm wood cabinetry paired with sleek black countertops. Upper cabinets include glass-fronted sections, perfect for displaying decorative items or storing everyday tableware within easy reach.</p><h3>Main Balcony &ndash; Your Front Row to the Mediterranean</h3><p>One of the apartment&rsquo;s standout features is the<strong>spacious glass-enclosed balcony</strong>facing the sea. The sliding panels can be fully opened during summer to let in the breeze or kept closed in cooler months to create a sheltered winter garden. From here, you can watch fishing boats in the morning, glowing sunsets in the evening, and the illuminated silhouette of Alanya Castle at night.</p><h3>Flexible and Bright Bedrooms</h3><p>The master bedroom offers direct balcony access and a wide-angle sea view&mdash;waking up here feels like staying in a boutique hotel every day. Currently, it is minimally furnished with a dark bed frame, leaving you the freedom to choose your preferred d&eacute;cor. Two additional rooms can serve as guest bedrooms, home offices, or walk-in wardrobes depending on your needs. Their versatility ensures the apartment adapts to different stages of life.</p><h3>Additional Balconies for Multiple Lifestyles</h3><p>While the main balcony captures the Mediterranean, the rear balconies overlook the Taurus Mountains and Alanya&rsquo;s cityscape. They make perfect spots for morning coffee, small herb gardens, or private reading corners.</p><h2>Ready for a Personal Touch &ndash; Furnished Yet Customizable</h2><p>Currently, the apartment is furnished with simple, functional pieces such as a white plastic outdoor dining set with blue-striped cushions&mdash;evoking a light coastal feel. However, it offers ample opportunity for style upgrades. Rattan or teak furniture could elevate the balcony into a true luxury outdoor lounge. Indoors, you could go for:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Modern Coastal:</strong>Whites, blues, and natural textures like linen and sisal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Contemporary Luxury:</strong>Glass, metal, and marble details with statement lighting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Rustic Mediterranean:</strong>Wooden furniture, warm textiles, and terracotta accents.</p></li></ul><p>The neutral color palette makes these transformations straightforward, ensuring your investment feels truly personal.</p><h2>Light and Orientation &ndash; Sunshine All Day</h2><p>Thanks to its<strong>south-west exposure</strong>, the apartment enjoys direct sunlight for most of the day. Morning light fills the bedrooms, while the living area and balcony glow in the golden afternoon sun. This orientation not only improves comfort but also reduces the need for artificial lighting, contributing to lower energy use.</p><h2>Complex Features &ndash; Full Comfort Right by the Sea</h2><p>The residence offers everything needed for year-round living:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Swimming Pool</strong>&ndash; Main and children&rsquo;s pools for cooling off in summer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Barbecue Area</strong>&ndash; Perfect for weekend gatherings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Green Spaces</strong>&ndash; Landscaped gardens creating a tranquil setting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parking</strong>&ndash; Open car park with easy access.</p></li><li><p><strong>Security</strong>&ndash; 24/7 camera system and door security.</p></li><li><p><strong>Generator</strong>&ndash; Ensures uninterrupted electricity supply.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caretaker Services</strong>&ndash; On-site assistance for maintenance and daily needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>Direct Beach Access</strong>&ndash; Safe underpass leading straight to the shoreline.</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, the building&rsquo;s<strong>frontline beach position</strong>guarantees your view remains unobstructed for years to come&mdash;an important factor for both enjoyment and long-term value.</p><h2>Investment Potential for Investors</h2><p>Tosmur has grown into one of Alanya&rsquo;s most desirable residential areas, attracting both local and international buyers. Its combination of beachfront living, easy access to city amenities, and a welcoming community makes it a prime choice for investors.</p><ul><li><p><strong>High Rental Potential</strong>&ndash; South-west facing apartments with uninterrupted sea views are among the most requested by holiday renters.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resale Value</strong>&ndash; Limited supply of true seafront properties ensures stable appreciation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexible Use</strong>&ndash; Suitable for year-round residence, seasonal holidays, or income generation.</p></li></ul><h2>Tosmur &ndash; Nature, Convenience, and Culture in One District</h2><p>Located just east of Alanya&rsquo;s city center, Tosmur offers a rare balance between urban convenience and natural beauty. It is best known for the<strong>Dim&ccedil;ay River</strong>, a refreshing escape during the hot summer months. Families and friends gather at riverside restaurants, enjoy picnics under the shade of trees, or cool off in the icy mountain water. For those seeking more excitement, the nearby go-kart track adds a dose of adrenaline.</p><p>Daily life in Tosmur is effortless. Within walking distance, you will find:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Supermarkets</strong>&ndash; For all essentials.</p></li><li><p><strong>Butchers &amp; Greengrocers</strong>&ndash; Offering fresh, local produce.</p></li><li><p><strong>Thursday Market</strong>&ndash; A vibrant bazaar with fruit, vegetables, clothing, and household items&mdash;almost like a small version of Istanbul&rsquo;s Grand Bazaar.</p></li></ul><p>While the district is compact enough to navigate on foot,<strong>bus stops</strong>on almost every corner connect you quickly to neighboring areas such as<strong>Kestel, Oba, and Cikcilli</strong>, as well as Alanya&rsquo;s bustling center.</p><p>Dining options range from traditional Turkish family restaurants to international cuisine. The famous<strong>Dim Cave</strong>, one of Turkey&rsquo;s largest publicly accessible caves, is also nearby, adding a unique natural attraction to the area.</p><h2>Living Here &ndash; A Day in the Life</h2><p>Imagine starting your morning with a walk along the shoreline, greeting the day with the sound of waves. After breakfast on your balcony, you could stroll to the Thursday market to pick up fresh fruit, enjoy a riverside lunch at Dim&ccedil;ay, then return home for an afternoon swim in the pool. In the evening, the balcony becomes your private theater for the Mediterranean sunset, followed by a relaxing barbecue with friends.</p><p>This is the lifestyle Tosmur offers&mdash;one where daily needs, leisure, and nature blend seamlessly.</p><h2>Why Choose Luxury Estate Turkey as Your Trusted Partner?</h2><p>Buying property in another country can feel overwhelming, but with the right partner, it becomes an exciting and secure journey.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>What if your next<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home in Alanya</a>gave you the privacy of a villa and the comfort of a seaside apartment?</h2><p data-start=\"282\" data-end=\"529\"><a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/blog/things-to-do-in-alanya-in-2025-a-complete-guide-to-leisure-excursions-and-family-activities\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Daily life in ALANYA</strong></a>flows between quiet streets, the local bazaar, and the nearby shoreline. Apartments here are usually either small and practical or large but dated &mdash; so finding a spacious, modern home in this area is something special.</p><p data-start=\"531\" data-end=\"837\">This 5-room apartment offers exactly that. With 210 m&sup2; of living space, three separate balconies, and its own private sauna, it feels more like a house than a flat. From the windows you can look over green gardens, with the sea visible in the distance, making the home bright and open throughout the day.</p><p data-start=\"839\" data-end=\"1097\">Only 300 meters from the beach, the apartment combines the independence of a larger residence with the everyday comfort of living in a well-kept complex. The building includes shared facilities, while still giving each owner the privacy of their own space.</p><p data-start=\"1099\" data-end=\"1338\">For families who want room to grow, professionals who need space to work from home, or investors looking for a property that stands out in Oba, this apartment brings together size, comfort, and location in a way that is rarely available.</p><h2>Interiors Where Modern Design Meets Everyday Warmth</h2><p>Spanning 190 m&sup2; net, the apartment stretches across two levels. The d&eacute;cor follows a refined palette of grey, white, and deep blue, accented with warm textures that soften its sophistication.</p><h3>A Living Room Framed by Light and Contrast</h3><p>Grey-toned walls pair with crisp white ceiling trims, creating a timeless canvas. A dark-grey L-shaped sofa anchors the room, balanced by plush navy armchairs. A glass coffee table with metal legs adds contemporary lightness. Large windows flood the space with sunlight, preventing darker shades from feeling heavy. Touches of greenery punctuate the modern lines, bringing vibrancy and a sense of life.</p><h3>A Kitchen Crafted for Function and Elegance</h3><p>The kitchen delivers both style and usability. White lacquer cabinets reflect light, while a grey marble-look backsplash adds depth. A black extractor hood brings contrast, echoing modern lines. Built-in appliances ensure sleek surfaces, while handleless cabinetry reinforces minimalism. The adjacent dining area, with grey upholstered chairs and a simple table, is designed for everyday family use without losing elegance.</p><h3>An Upper Floor Lounge for Relaxed Living</h3><p>The top floor introduces a second lounge &mdash; more casual, more intimate. A burnt-orange L-shaped sofa and dark drapes create a cozy cocoon. With its sloped ceiling and warm tones, this space is perfect for family evenings, movie nights, or simply unwinding away from the formality of the main living area.</p><h3>Bedrooms with Character and Identity</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Navy and White Suite</strong>&ndash; A crisp white bedframe contrasts against deep-blue tones, giving the room a boutique hotel feel.</p></li><li><p><strong>Earth-Toned Room</strong>&ndash; Terracotta and wood accents mix with patterned wallpaper for a youthful, dynamic energy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Calm Grey Retreat</strong>&ndash; Soft orange details and pastel wall motifs create a soothing and airy ambiance.</p></li></ul><p>Each room has its own character, allowing different family members to express personality without losing overall harmony.</p><h3>A Private Sauna Built Into the Home</h3><p>One of the apartment&rsquo;s most exclusive features is the in-home sauna. This rare addition transforms daily routines into spa experiences, offering relaxation and wellness right at home. With two fully equipped bathrooms supporting it, comfort is always at hand.</p><h3>Balconies and Terrace &ndash; Where Indoor Meets Outdoor</h3><p>The apartment offers three balconies plus a large terrace. The terrace in particular becomes a true outdoor living room: ideal for hosting dinners, relaxing with friends, or creating a barbecue corner. Views over landscaped gardens and the sea remind residents daily of their privileged position near the coast.</p><h2>Comfort, Security, and Shared Facilities</h2><p>Beyond the apartment itself, the building complex offers practical amenities and social opportunities:</p><ul><li><p>Outdoor swimming pool with sun terraces</p></li><li><p>Children&rsquo;s pool and playground</p></li><li><p>Landscaped green zones and barbecue corners</p></li><li><p>Fireplace lounge for winter gatherings</p></li><li><p>Caretaker services and 24/7 camera security</p></li><li><p>Generator backup for uninterrupted comfort</p></li><li><p>Easy access to public transport and just a short walk to the beach</p></li></ul><p>The balance is clear: you enjoy the independence of a spacious home, but with the safety and convenience of a managed residence.</p><h2>Oba &ndash; Where Daily Life is Effortless</h2><p>Life in Oba offers far more than its long sandy beaches. Here, modern conveniences and local character mix seamlessly:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Markets Twice a Week</strong>&ndash; On Mondays and Thursdays, bazaars fill the streets with fresh produce, clothing, and home goods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cafes and Restaurants</strong>&ndash; A diverse mix caters to both local and international tastes.</p></li><li><p><strong>Healthcare Nearby</strong>&ndash; Alanya Training and Research Hospital is within the neighborhood.</p></li><li><p><strong>Seamless Transport</strong>&ndash; Almost all bus routes pass through Oba, connecting quickly to Alanya center, Tosmur, Kestel, and Mahmutlar.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sports and Leisure</strong>&ndash; Cycling paths along the sea, tennis courts, and football fields are part of everyday life.</p></li></ul><p>It is a neighborhood designed not just for holiday stays but for long-term living with ease.</p><h2>Who Will Value This Apartment Most?</h2><h3>Families Wanting Both Space and Functionality</h3><p>With five rooms, three balconies, and 210 m&sup2; of living space, families can enjoy privacy without losing shared areas. The children&rsquo;s pool and playground add even more convenience for parents.</p><h3>Investors Seeking Rare Value</h3><p>Apartments of this size and design, just 300 meters from the beach, are scarce in Oba. As a result, rental demand is high &mdash; both from long-term tenants and premium holiday lets. High rental yields are a realistic expectation.</p><h3>Retirees and Long-Term Residents</h3><p>For retirees, the private sauna, sea views, and calm yet connected location create an environment of comfort and reassurance. The combination of health services, transport, and social amenities ensures an easy lifestyle.</p><h3>Buyers Focused on Prestige</h3><p>The design, size, and private features of this apartment appeal to those who see their home as a statement of status. It offers not just a place to live, but a symbol of refined living.</p><h2>Why This Apartment is a Smart Investment</h2><p>Alanya&rsquo;s real estate market continues to grow, but opportunities like this are increasingly rare. Apartments near the sea, with private features such as a sauna and large terraces, appreciate faster in value and attract higher rental rates.</p><p>This apartment offers dual benefits: a home that enhances everyday life, and an asset that secures financial growth.</p><h2>The Advantage of Working with<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luxury Estate Turkey</a></h2><p>Purchasing property abroad can be complex, but with the right guidance it becomes straightforward and secure. At Luxury Estate Turkey, we offer:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Local Expertise with International Understanding</strong>&ndash; We interpret the market clearly for global buyers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Comprehensive Legal Support</strong>&ndash; From contracts to residence permit applications, every detail is covered.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored Property Matching</strong>&ndash; We focus on your goals, whether investment, family life, or retirement.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sales Care</strong>&ndash; Rental assistance, management, and resale support continue beyond purchase.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inspection Trips</strong>&ndash; For international buyers, guided visits make confident decisions possible.</p></li></ul><p>Choosing us means choosing transparency, professionalism, and a long-term partner in Turkey&rsquo;s property market.</p><p>This<strong>5 room apartment in Oba</strong>is more than a residence.

    "property_title": "Duplex Apartment for sale in Best Home 25 - Close to Cleopatra Beach",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>3 Room Duplex for Sale in Alanya &ndash; 500m to Cleopatra</h2><p>If you want an address that puts the Mediterranean into your daily routine, this 3 room duplex for sale in Alanya at Best Home 25 does exactly that. You live<strong>500 meters from the<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/near-kleopatra-beach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cleopatra beach</a></strong>, so swims before breakfast, sunset walks, and spur-of-the-moment caf&eacute; stops become habits rather than rare treats. Meanwhile, the home itself combines a<strong>south-facing</strong>plan,<strong>110 m&sup2;</strong>of smartly used space, and a<strong>furnished</strong>interior with<strong>white goods</strong>included. Therefore, you move in fast, enjoy comfort immediately, and keep your focus on the lifestyle that drew you to Alanya in the first place.</p><p>Moreover, the complex supports that lifestyle with a<strong>pool</strong>,<strong>indoor pool</strong>,<strong>fitness</strong>,<strong>sauna</strong>,<strong>generator</strong>,<strong>elevator</strong>,<strong>security</strong>,<strong>24/7 camera</strong>,<strong>caretaker</strong>,<strong>children&rsquo;s room</strong>,<strong>children&rsquo;s pool</strong>,<strong>green area</strong>,<strong>barbecue</strong>,<strong>lobby</strong>, and<strong>cable TV/satellite</strong>&mdash;all within a setting<strong>close to the beach</strong>and<strong>near Cleopatra</strong>. Because the<strong>area is open for residence permit</strong>, you also gain a straightforward legal path for longer stays. Consequently, this<strong>3 room duplex for sale in Alanya</strong>serves both as a personal base and as an asset with<strong>high rental potential</strong>.</p><h2>Location and Lifestyle &mdash; 500 m to the Sand Near Cleopatra</h2><p>Step outside and the rhythm of the west side of Alanya takes over. Streets lined with caf&eacute;s and restaurants make social plans easy; you simply walk out, look around, and choose. In addition,<strong>supermarkets</strong>sit nearby for daily needs, and if you prefer the freshest ingredients, a visit to the<strong>Hal</strong>covers fish, meat, and vegetables in one efficient trip.</p><p>Because the shoreline stretches for kilometers, you can walk, jog, or cycle along the promenade whenever the mood strikes.<strong>Beach clubs</strong>add variety&mdash;sometimes with<strong>concerts</strong>&mdash;so weekends can feel different from weekdays even when you stay close to home. For those who like activity,<strong>water sports</strong>are available throughout the season. Meanwhile, Alanya offers more than the sea: an<strong>indoor Olympic swimming pool</strong>supports training and family time in cooler months, and<strong>paragliding</strong>suits days when you crave a dash of adrenaline.</p><p>Connectivity stays simple. Buses run frequently, taxis wait at most corners, and the<strong>intercity bus station</strong>sits on this side of town. Therefore, you move around Alanya without friction. If you want mini-escapes, the<strong>new marina</strong>,<strong>Ula≈ü Beach</strong>, and<strong>Konaklƒ±</strong>are close; for a taste of history, the<strong>ancient city of Hamaxia</strong>sits only a few kilometers away. Consequently, you build a weekly rhythm that balances easy routines and small adventures.</p><p>All of this surrounds a home that faces<strong>south</strong>, so daylight pours in and the interior stays bright. Besides, you enjoy both<strong>city view</strong>and<strong>mountain view</strong>notes from the duplex&rsquo;s outlooks; the scenery keeps pace with your day&mdash;urban energy below, natural silhouettes beyond.</p><h2>Inside the Duplex &mdash; Modern, Clean, and Move-In Ready</h2><p>You enter a space that reads modern and calm.<strong>Light wall colors</strong>amplify natural light, while<strong>bright flooring</strong>reflects it across the rooms. As a result, the duplex feels larger than its<strong>110 m&sup2;</strong>on paper. The style stays consistent: clean lines, simple geometry, and a palette that makes furnishing straightforward. Because the home comes<strong>furnished</strong>with<strong>white goods</strong>, you focus on arrangement rather than procurement.</p><h3>Living Area &mdash; Social Energy at the Center</h3><p>The living room favors conversation and comfort.<strong>Dark gray and deep burgundy sofas</strong>add visual depth without overwhelming the room. A<strong>minimalist coffee table</strong>and<strong>TV unit</strong>keep lines tidy;<strong>round patterned rugs</strong>pull the seating zone together and warm the tone underfoot. Meanwhile,<strong>wood shelving</strong>offers practical display without clutter. Overhead, a<strong>sleek ceiling fixture</strong>adds a quiet note of luxury. Consequently, you get a room that supports evenings with friends as easily as quiet afternoons with a book.</p><h3>American Kitchen &mdash; Cook, Host, and Stay Connected</h3><p>The kitchen blends with the living area in a true<strong>American kitchen</strong>layout.<strong>Gloss-white cabinets</strong>present a fresh face to daily cooking;<strong>black counters</strong>and<strong>marble-patterned backsplash</strong>provide contrast and durability. Integrated<strong>white goods</strong>(oven, hob, extractor, and more) fit neatly into the cabinetry, so everything looks cohesive from day one. Because the kitchen opens to the living space, you cook while staying part of the conversation. Therefore, hosting feels natural: set out appetizers, plate mains, and slide back to the sofa without losing the thread.</p><h3>Bedrooms &mdash; Rest, Air, and Practical Comfort</h3><p>The<strong>primary bedroom</strong>pairs<strong>wood headboard and nightstands</strong>with light bedding for a warm, uncluttered feel. In the<strong>second bedroom</strong>,<strong>two single beds</strong>offer flexibility&mdash;guests, siblings, or a combination of sleep and study zones. In both rooms,<strong>air-conditioning</strong>and<strong>large windows</strong>support comfort and airflow. Consequently, your sleep stays consistent, and daytime use feels fresh rather than closed in.</p><h3>Balconies and Outlooks &mdash; City and Mountain Notes</h3><p>Generous balconies extend the living space outward. One balcony suits<strong>dining al fresco</strong>with a table and chairs; the other invites you to sit and simply watch the<strong>city</strong>and<strong>mountain</strong>contours shift with the light. Because the duplex sits in<strong>Best Home 25</strong>, the exterior mirrors the interior&mdash;<strong>modern architecture</strong>with a clear identity.</p><h3>Systems and Daily Comfort &mdash; South Aspect and Hot Water</h3><p>Comfort comes from invisible decisions as much as visible ones. The<strong>south-facing</strong>orientation delivers consistent daylight; blinds and curtains modulate it without shutting rooms down. An<strong>electric water heater</strong>provides predictable hot water on your schedule. Meanwhile, the<strong>elevator</strong>smooths daily movement, and the<strong>generator</strong>protects critical functions during power interruptions. Therefore, you live without second-guessing the basics.</p><h2>Best Home 25 &mdash; Amenities That Raise Everyday Quality</h2><p>A strong home becomes better when the complex around it works just as hard.<strong>Best Home 25</strong>does exactly that with amenities that elevate daily living and strengthen investment appeal.</p><h3>Pools for Every Season</h3><p>Swim outdoors when the weather invites you; choose the<strong>indoor pool</strong>when it doesn&rsquo;t. Because you have both, you keep a consistent routine across the year. Moreover, a<strong>children&rsquo;s pool</strong>ensures young swimmers practice and play safely.</p><h3>Health, Heat, and Recovery</h3><p>The<strong>fitness</strong>room lets you maintain a schedule without external memberships. After a session, move to the<strong>sauna</strong>to unwind; your body will thank you for the recovery. Consequently, exercise slots naturally into your life rather than becoming a separate expedition.</p><h3>Safety, Order, and Connectivity</h3><p>A<strong>security</strong>presence and<strong>24/7 camera</strong>coverage support peace of mind. A<strong>caretaker</strong>coordinates day-to-day order, which matters whether you live year-round or visit periodically. In addition,<strong>cable TV/satellite</strong>readiness and the complex<strong>lobby</strong>support both connectivity and a clear arrival experience.</p><h3>Family and Social Spaces</h3><p>A dedicated<strong>children&rsquo;s room</strong>creates a safe indoor environment for younger residents. Outside, the<strong>green area</strong>gives you a softer place to pause, while the<strong>barbecue</strong>spot turns weekends into mini-gatherings without leaving home. Consequently, those who prefer a stay-in day still find options that feel like going out.</p><h3>Reliability Under the Hood</h3><p>The<strong>generator</strong>safeguards essentials, from elevators to common-area systems. Therefore, even rare interruptions stay manageable. Meanwhile, the<strong>elevator</strong>improves accessibility for everyone&mdash;returning from the supermarket or heading up with luggage feels simple.</p><p>Because the complex sits<strong>close to the beach</strong>and<strong>near Cleopatra</strong>, all of these amenities connect directly to the reasons you chose Alanya: sea, sun, ease, and a social atmosphere that feels alive but not overwhelming.</p><h2>Rental Logic &mdash; Why This 3 Room Duplex for Sale in Alanya Attracts Tenants</h2><p>From an investor&rsquo;s perspective, several factors compound into stable demand:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Proximity to the beach (500 m) near Cleopatra</strong>drives search interest year-round.</p></li><li><p>The<strong>duplex</strong>format adds status and functional separation between zones.</p></li><li><p>The<strong>amenity stack</strong>(pools, fitness, sauna, kids&rsquo; areas, security) broadens the audience&mdash;from families to remote professionals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Furnished</strong>with<strong>white goods</strong>means faster onboarding between tenancies.</p></li><li><p><strong>City view</strong>and<strong>mountain view</strong>enrich the value proposition in every season.</p></li><li><p>The<strong>area open for residence permit</strong>can appeal to longer-term tenants organizing their paperwork.</p></li><li><p>A<strong>cash payment &mdash; discount offer</strong>sharpens entry price and can improve ROI.</p></li></ol><p>Moreover, the surrounding neighborhood offers caf&eacute; density, easy transport, and quick errands. Therefore, tenants imagine routine immediately, which shortens decision time. Because many guests research<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">property in Alanya</a>by proximity to Cleopatra, this 3 room duplex for sale in Alanya naturally appears on the right shortlists.</p><p>To keep marketing organic and honest, present the home exactly as it lives: describe the south light, show the indoor pool for winter stays, and note that supermarkets and buses sit close by. Consequently, inquiries become viewings, and viewings convert at a higher rate.</p><h2>Who Benefits Most from This Home</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Beach-first residents</strong>who want walking distance to the sand without giving up city convenience</p></li><li><p><strong>Small families or couples</strong>who need two bedrooms and value kid-friendly amenities</p></li><li><p><strong>Remote professionals</strong>who optimize for caf&eacute;s, fitness on site, and simple transport</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>seeking a ready, well-specified unit with<strong>high rental potential</strong>and a clean legal profile (<strong>residence permit</strong>area)</p></li><li><p><strong>Long-stay planners</strong>who prefer to arrive, settle, and personalize gradually thanks to an already<strong>furnished</strong>interior with<strong>white goods</strong></p></li></ul><p>Because the home balances lifestyle and practicality, it adapts as needs shift. Today&rsquo;s guest room may evolve into a nursery; a corner desk may expand into a full home office without rewriting the plan.</p><h3>Payment Advantage &mdash; Ask Us About the Cash Discount</h3><p>A cash payment &mdash; discount offer currently applies through<strong data-start=\"88\" data-end=\"112\">Luxury Estate Turkey</strong>.

    "property_title": "50m to Sea apartment in Arbat 2 Residence Alanya Center",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>4 Room Apartment for Sale in Arbat 2 Residence Alanya &ndash; Modern Comfort Steps from the Sea!</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">You know how some places just have that perfect combination going on? This 4-room apartment in<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/center\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alanya Center</a>, Arbat 2 Residence is definitely one of those places. We're talking about 100 square meters with three bedrooms and a living room that has this really nice modern city chic vibe. And here's the kicker - you're literally 50 meters from the sea. I mean, you could probably hear the waves from your window on quiet evenings.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The whole place comes fully furnished with stylish d&eacute;cor, so you could basically pack your bags, move in tomorrow, and be completely set up. No hunting around for furniture or trying to figure out what works with what - it's all been thought through already. The three bedrooms give you plenty of flexibility too, whether you need space for family, want a home office, or like having a guest room for when people come to visit.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">What I really like about the location is that you're right in the heart of Alanya. Everything's within walking distance - the beach obviously, but also good restaurants where you can grab dinner without planning ahead, shopping for daily stuff, and all those historic landmarks that make Alanya interesting beyond just being a beach town. You get that city convenience without the chaos of a huge metropolis.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Whether you're thinking about this for your family, as a professional looking for a nice place to call home, or even as an investment opportunity, it's got that sweet spot combination of being in the perfect location with solid style and real growth potential. Properties this close to the water in established neighborhoods like this don't come up every day.</p><h2 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>The Interior - It's Got That Perfect Balance</strong></h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">When you walk into the living room, you immediately get what this place is about. There's this nice mix of overhead lighting and a statement chandelier that gives it a luxurious feel without being over the top. The grey marble-look flooring runs throughout, which I think is a smart choice - it looks sophisticated but it's also practical for a place this close to the beach.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The deep green velvet L-shaped sofa really catches your eye. It's one of those pieces that's both stylish and actually comfortable to sink into after a long day. The TV unit has these black marble details that create this nice contrast - everything feels intentional but not stuffy, you know?</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The kitchen flows right into the living space, which is great for entertaining or just daily life. They've gone with dark cabinets but balanced them with warm wood tones, so it doesn't feel too heavy or masculine. The white dining table was a smart move too - it lightens everything up and keeps the space feeling open and airy. You can tell someone really thought about how all these colors and textures work together to create something that feels modern and urban but still welcoming.</p><h3 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>The Bedrooms - Each One Has Its Own Personality</strong></h3><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The master bedroom is all about creating a calm retreat. They've used pastel tones throughout, and there's this nice upholstered headboard that makes the whole room feel more polished. The curtains and bedding are in these soft, muted colors that just make you want to relax the moment you walk in. The lighting is elegant but not flashy - it's the kind of room where you'd actually want to unwind at the end of the day.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The other two bedrooms take a different approach, which I actually really like. One of them is clearly set up with younger people in mind - there's a work desk, a simple but nice bed, and clean modern lighting. It's ready to go whether someone needs a study space, a home office, or just a comfortable guest room. The flexibility is really appealing because these rooms could work as kids' bedrooms, home offices, or spaces for visitors depending on what stage of life you're in.</p><h3 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>The Balcony - This Is Where You'll Spend Your Time</strong></h3><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Honestly, the balcony might be the best part of the whole place. It's wide enough that you can actually put a proper dining table and chairs out there, which makes such a difference. And with the sea just 50 meters away, you're getting those water views without the crazy premium you'd pay for direct beachfront.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">I can picture spending a lot of time out there - morning coffee while watching the water, long dinners on summer evenings, or just hanging out with friends over drinks. In places like Alanya, the balcony really becomes an extension of your living space for a good chunk of the year. This one's big enough and positioned well enough that you'd actually use it regularly, not just look at it.</p><h3 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>The Overall Feel - Stylish But Not Trying Too Hard</strong></h3><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">What I appreciate about this apartment is that it manages to look really good without feeling like it's trying too hard to impress. The color scheme - those greys, blacks, and deep greens - gives it a prestigious feel but it's not overwhelming or cold. It's sophisticated but still feels like a place you'd want to come home to and relax in.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">They've basically created what I'd call a \"modern city holiday home\" vibe. It's got enough luxury touches to feel special, but it's also comfortable and practical for actual daily living. Whether you're using it as your primary residence or as a vacation property, it's the kind of place that works for both relaxing alone and entertaining friends.</p><h2>Facilities in Arbat 2 Residence</h2><p>The apartment gains even more value thanks to the facilities of<strong>Arbat 2 Residence</strong>, which include:</p><ul><li><p>Outdoor swimming pool and children&rsquo;s pool</p></li><li><p>Fitness center and sauna</p></li><li><p>Table tennis and billiards for leisure</p></li><li><p>Green areas and bicycle parking</p></li><li><p>24/7 security with cameras</p></li><li><p>Generator and caretaker services</p></li><li><p>Barbecue and social spaces</p></li></ul><p>With these features, residents enjoy both convenience and recreation right at home. Children have safe play areas, while adults can relax by the pool or stay active in the gym.</p><h2>Who Is This Apartment For?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Foreign investors</strong>: With its central location and proximity to the sea, rental demand is guaranteed. Holidaymakers are drawn to properties this close to the beach.</p></li><li><p><strong>Young professionals and families</strong>: The modern interior, practical layout, and complex facilities make it attractive for everyday living.</p></li><li><p><strong>Holiday buyers</strong>: For those who want the comfort of a five-star hotel but the warmth of a home, this apartment offers the best of both worlds.</p></li></ul><p>In short, this apartment suits anyone who values both style and practicality&mdash;a place that is chic without sacrificing everyday functionality.</p><h2>What Daily Life Actually Looks Like in Central Alanya?</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Living right in the center of Alanya is one of those experiences where you never really feel stuck or bored. The streets around you are constantly buzzing with life - there are coffee shops on practically every corner, which is great because you'll probably become a regular at two or three of them. The restaurant scene is really diverse too. You've got everything from Turkish classics to international cuisine, so you can satisfy pretty much any craving without having to travel far.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Shopping is ridiculously convenient. Need new jewelry? There are plenty of stores to browse. Want to check out some global fashion brands or hunt for unique pieces in local boutiques? It's all right there. Even daily essentials are easy - fresh produce, cosmetics, electronics - you can pretty much handle all your shopping needs on foot. It's the kind of setup where you might actually start leaving your car at home more often than you'd expect.</p><h3 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Living Among History</strong></h3><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">One of the coolest things about this location is how casually you'll encounter Alanya's history. The Red Tower and Alanya Castle aren't just tourist attractions you visit once - they become part of your regular scenery. You might find yourself walking past the old shipyard on your way to grab dinner, or using these landmarks to give directions to friends visiting. It's pretty special to have that kind of historical significance woven into your everyday routine.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The beaches are another huge plus. Damlata≈ü Beach is literally just minutes away, which means spontaneous beach days become a real possibility. Feeling stressed after work? A quick walk to the water can completely change your mood. And if you want to mix things up, the Alanya Cable Car is right there for when you want to see the whole area from above - great for impressing visitors or just treating yourself to a different perspective.</p><h3 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>Getting Around and Going Out</strong></h3><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The transportation situation is actually really well thought out. The 101 bus runs along the coast and connects all the major beaches, so you can explore different spots without worrying about parking or driving. If you want to venture further out to areas like Oba or Tosmur, the 202 lines have you covered. And honestly, taxis are everywhere - you'll never be stuck trying to get somewhere.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Evenings here have this great energy that's hard to describe until you experience it. You could spend weeks just trying different restaurants - there's world cuisine from pretty much everywhere you can think of. But sometimes the best nights are the simple ones at a small local caf&eacute; where you become friends with the owner and other regulars. The seaside promenade is always lively too, perfect for those nights when you want to be around people and energy without committing to any specific plan.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The thing is, you've got options for whatever mood you're in. Want something quiet and intimate? There are plenty of small spots tucked away. Feel like being social and meeting new people? The busier areas along the water are perfect. It's that flexibility that makes living here feel less like being tied down to one routine and more like having access to whatever kind of evening you're in the mood for.</p><h2>Investment Potential</h2><p>From an investment perspective, this apartment is a standout. Its location just<strong>50 meters from the sea</strong>ensures strong holiday rental appeal. The modern design and full furnishings increase its attractiveness for long-term tenants as well.</p><p>Alanya&rsquo;s real estate market continues to grow, with international demand driving steady appreciation. Properties in the center with sea views are among the most sought after. For buyers seeking both rental income and capital growth, this is a secure option.</p><h2 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>We Do Things Differently!</strong></h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Look, buying property in another country can feel pretty overwhelming. There are so many things that can go wrong, and you're dealing with unfamiliar systems, language barriers, and let's be honest - you don't always know who you can trust. That's where we come in at Luxury Estate Turkey.<br /><br />We've been doing this for years, and we've learned that what people really need isn't just someone to show them properties - they need someone who's going to be straight with them and stick around after the paperwork is signed.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">We handle all the stuff that can make your head spin: title deed transfers, navigating the legal requirements, helping with residence permit applications if you're going that route, and even citizenship applications through property purchase if that's something you're considering.<br /><br />We speak multiple languages, so you're not going to get lost in translation, and we believe in being completely transparent about everything - the good, the challenging, and everything in between.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">But here's what really sets us apart: we don't disappear once you've bought the place. Need help setting up utilities? We're here. Thinking about renting it out and want guidance on rental management? We've got you covered. Have questions about something six months down the line? Give us a call. Our clients tell us all the time that this ongoing support is what made the difference for them. We're not just selling you a property - we're helping you build a relationship with a new place.</p><h3 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>This Could Be Your Next Move</strong></h3><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This 4-room apartment in Arbat 2 Residence really does hit all the marks. You've got that incredible location just steps from the sea, the stylish modern design that's ready to go, and the kind of investment potential that makes financial sense whether you're planning to live there, use it as a vacation home, or rent it out.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Whether you're a family looking for a Mediterranean base, someone wanting a holiday retreat that actually feels like home, or an investor who sees the opportunity here, this place delivers on pretty much every front.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Why don't you give us a call to set up a viewing? We can walk you through the apartment, talk about the area, answer any questions you have, and give you a real sense of what living there would be like. Properties this close to the water in Alanya's center don't come up very often, and when they do, they tend to move quickly. Let's make sure you don't miss out on something that could be exactly what you're looking for.</p></div>",

    "property_title": "Mediterranean Olive Villa with Panoramic Terraces in Alanya",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>What if your holiday¬†<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home in Alanya</a>¬†could feel like a Mediterranean postcard brought to life?</h2><p>Kargƒ±cak is one of those rare Alanya neighborhoods where green hills meet the clear sea, and where life flows at a slower, more relaxed pace. Just 20 minutes from Alanya‚Äôs center, this area draws residents who want clean beaches, quiet evenings, and easy access to daily needs without sacrificing space or comfort. In the heart of this setting rises¬†<strong>Olive Villa</strong>, a 5 room, 250 m¬≤ home that brings together traditional Mediterranean architecture and practical family living.</p><p>Built with curved balconies, terraced gardens, and the warmth of natural textures, the villa feels like a timeless retreat. At the same time, it offers modern amenities, pool access, and all the qualities buyers look for when balancing personal use with investment potential.</p><h2>Architecture That Breathes Mediterranean Spirit</h2><p>The villa‚Äôs design immediately recalls classic coastal aesthetics: terracotta-tiled roofs, ochre-toned stucco walls, white window frames, and flowing balcony lines. These elements don‚Äôt just look beautiful ‚Äî they also respond to the climate, shading interiors from summer sun while opening generously to light and breezes.</p><p>Curved half-moon balconies, wide window openings, and a striped awning above the main terrace make the fa√ßade dynamic and welcoming. On the sloped plot, tiered gardens with palm and low-maintenance greenery frame the structure, while elevated positioning ensures panoramic views of both the Taurus Mountains and the Mediterranean.</p><h2>Outdoor Living as the Centerpiece</h2><p>Life in Olive Villa extends outdoors, across several levels:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Ground Terrace</strong>¬†‚Äì A semicircular space perfect for large outdoor dining. Hosting family meals or summer gatherings here feels effortless.</p></li><li><p><strong>First-Floor Balconies</strong>¬†‚Äì Spread across two fa√ßades, they allow different uses morning and evening, from coffee nooks to sunset lounges.</p></li><li><p><strong>Roof Terrace</strong>¬†‚Äì The highlight of the property, offering privacy, views, and space for a jacuzzi, sunbeds, or an open-air lounge.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pool Connection</strong>¬†‚Äì Overlooking the communal pool, terraces provide both views and parental oversight. Families can enjoy relaxation while children play safely below.</p></li></ul><p>Together, these areas transform the villa into a year-round holiday retreat, with each family member finding their own favorite corner.</p><h2>Interiors with Warmth and Character</h2><p>Hints of the interior style can already be read from the exterior: warm tones, natural finishes, and a design that blends function with atmosphere.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Living Area</strong>¬†‚Äì A corner fireplace anchors the main lounge, making the villa suitable not only for summer stays but also cozy winter evenings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Material Palette</strong>¬†‚Äì Beige ceramic flooring, peach-toned walls, and rattan details create a light yet homey environment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Plan Flow</strong>¬†‚Äì The semi-open layout connects living, dining, and kitchen zones while keeping defined areas for family activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bedrooms</strong>¬†‚Äì Each room benefits from balcony or terrace access, ensuring that light and views remain central to everyday living.</p></li></ul><p>The d√©cor is best described as¬†<strong>Mediterranean Classic</strong>¬†‚Äî timeless rather than trendy, and perfectly in tune with the villa‚Äôs location.</p><h2>Who Will Find Olive Villa Ideal?</h2><h3>Large Families and Multi-Generational Living</h3><p>With five rooms and 250 m¬≤, the villa allows space for everyone. Multiple terraces and private corners ensure that children, parents, and grandparents all enjoy both privacy and togetherness.</p><h3>Long-Term Holidaymakers</h3><p>Just 1 km from the sea and well-connected by buses to Alanya‚Äôs center, Olive Villa offers the practicality of a second home that works year-round. Extended stays become comfortable with its size, terraces, and fireplace.</p><h3>Investors</h3><p>The villa‚Äôs spacious design, views, and furnished offering make it highly attractive for both short-term holiday rentals and long-term tenants. Outdoor areas, mountain‚Äìsea panoramas, and resort-style amenities significantly boost rental appeal.</p><h3>Home-Office Seekers</h3><p>For buyers who blend work with leisure, the roof terrace or upper balconies can easily transform into inspiring home offices with panoramic views.</p><h2>Value-Enhancing Touches</h2><p>The villa already presents a strong character, but subtle updates can elevate its appeal further:</p><ul><li><p>Refreshing the exterior with lighter beige paint and matte-white railings modernizes its look.</p></li><li><p>Installing a retractable pergola and comprehensive outdoor lighting improves evening use and enhances perceived quality.</p></li><li><p>Adding Mediterranean landscaping with potted olive, lemon, or rosemary plants reinforces the identity of the home.</p></li></ul><h2>Kargƒ±cak ‚Äì A Location for Relaxed Daily Living</h2><p>Living in Olive Villa also means enjoying Kargƒ±cak‚Äôs lifestyle:</p><ul><li><p>Clean, uncrowded beaches and fish restaurants along the waterfront.</p></li><li><p>Weekly access to Dim River and Dim Cave for nature escapes.</p></li><li><p>Daily needs covered by local shops, with Mahmutlar and Alanya center close for larger shopping trips.</p></li><li><p>Reliable transport with frequent buses (routes 1, 2, and 3) reaching Alanya in 20 minutes.</p></li></ul><p>The area attracts both locals and foreign residents for its calm, green setting while still offering restaurants, cafes, and bars for social life.</p><h2>A Secure Investment with Everyday Comfort</h2><p>Olive Villa doesn‚Äôt only answer lifestyle needs; it also holds investment value. With its generous size, family-friendly design, and proximity to both nature and the sea, it appeals to multiple buyer profiles. The presence of a fireplace, jacuzzi-ready terraces, and furnished interiors further strengthen its rental and resale potential.</p><h2>Why Work with Luxury Estate Turkey?</h2><p>Choosing a property abroad is a big step, and having a trusted partner matters. Luxury Estate Turkey combines market knowledge, legal guidance, and after-sales support to make the journey seamless.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transparent Advice</strong>¬†‚Äì Honest guidance on pricing, paperwork, and expectations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and Logistical Expertise</strong>¬†‚Äì From contracts to utility setup, everything is managed clearly.</p></li><li><p><strong>Residency Support</strong>¬†‚Äì For buyers considering long stays, we provide advice on residence permits.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored Property Search</strong>¬†‚Äì Every recommendation matches your personal needs.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sales Care</strong>¬†‚Äì Rental management, furnishing services, and resale assistance.</p></li></ul><p>We also organize inspection trips for international clients, ensuring you can experience both the property and the lifestyle before making your decision.</p><p>Olive Villa in Kargƒ±cak is more than a home ‚Äî it is a statement of Mediterranean living.

    "property_title": "Apartment for Sale in Alanya ‚Äì 40m to Cleopatra Beach",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>4 Room Apartment for Sale in Alanya &ndash; 40m to Cleopatra</h2><p>If you&rsquo;re searching for a 4 room apartment for sale in Alanya that places daily life within a few steps of the sea, this home delivers precisely that. You&rsquo;re just<strong>40 meters from<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/near-kleopatra-beach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Cleopatra Beach</a></strong>, with caf&eacute;s<strong>10 m</strong>away, restaurants at<strong>50 m</strong>, and a supermarket at<strong>70 m</strong>. Consequently, your routine becomes effortless: morning swims, quick coffee breaks, and spontaneous dinners all fit into the same short walk. Meanwhile, the apartment itself pairs a<strong>special luxury design</strong>with a<strong>west-facing</strong>orientation, an<strong>American kitchen</strong>,<strong>full underfloor heating</strong>, and a practical mix of<strong>furnishings and white goods</strong>so you can settle in immediately.</p><p>Because two rooms remain empty by design, you gain the freedom to tailor the space to your life&mdash;guest suite, study, or kids&rsquo; rooms&mdash;while one bedroom already waits for you on day one. Therefore, this<strong>4 room apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>works equally well for beach-first lifestyles, long stays, and investment plans focused on high occupancy.</p><h2>Location: Only 40 Meters to Cleopatra Beach</h2><p>The address speaks for itself. You step outside and the sea is practically right there&mdash;<strong>40 meters</strong>to the sand of<strong>Cleopatra Beach</strong>. In addition, the immediate neighborhood on Alanya&rsquo;s west side feels relaxed yet social, with a friendly mosaic of nationalities and a day-to-night rhythm built around caf&eacute;s and restaurants.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Caf&eacute;s: 10 m</strong>&mdash; a quick espresso or tea is part of your stroll</p></li><li><p><strong>Restaurants: 50 m</strong>&mdash; choose local or international kitchens on a whim</p></li><li><p><strong>Supermarket: 70 m</strong>&mdash; groceries become a short stop, not a separate trip</p></li><li><p><strong>Bus stop nearby</strong>&mdash; frequent buses take you where you need to go</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, the coastline stretches for kilometers, so walking, running, or cycling along the promenade becomes second nature.<strong>Beach clubs</strong>in the area add another layer, sometimes with<strong>concerts</strong>and events. If you prefer active days,<strong>water sports</strong>abound. For instance, you can mix a relaxed beach routine with planned activities whenever you like.</p><p>Alanya&rsquo;s west also keeps you connected. Therefore, reaching the city center stays easy, and places such as the<strong>new marina</strong>,<strong>Ula≈ü Beach</strong>, and<strong>Konaklƒ±</strong>sit within comfortable reach. Meanwhile, those who enjoy a touch of history can plan a short outing to the<strong>ancient city of Hamaxia</strong>, only a few kilometers away. For everyday practicality, you&rsquo;ll find plenty of<strong>supermarkets</strong>and, if you want fresh produce, fish, or meat, a visit to the<strong>Hal</strong>simplifies weekly shopping. In addition, an<strong>intercity bus terminal</strong>on this side of town broadens your travel options.</p><p>Consequently, the surroundings support a lifestyle that balances rest and activity. You can keep things easy&mdash;long beach walks, sunset coffees&mdash;or opt for more adrenaline on certain days. If you&rsquo;re the adventurous type,<strong>paragliding</strong>also appears on the local menu. Likewise, sports-minded residents appreciate access to facilities in the area, including the<strong>indoor Olympic swimming pool</strong>.</p><h2>Interior &amp; Design: A Modern Base You Can Personalize</h2><h3>Special Luxury Design with Practical Comfort</h3><p>Open the door and a<strong>modern, luxury base</strong>welcomes you:<strong>wood panels</strong>add warmth,<strong>marble-look floors</strong>keep things bright and easy to clean, and<strong>considered lighting</strong>ties the aesthetic together. Consequently, the apartment feels polished without losing its everyday practicality. The palette and materials form a neutral canvas that makes furnishing straightforward; your own taste won&rsquo;t clash with what&rsquo;s already here.</p><h3>American Kitchen for Connected Living</h3><p>The<strong>American kitchen</strong>integrates with the living area, so cooking and conversation flow naturally. In addition, included<strong>white goods</strong>reduce setup time. You can invite friends over sooner and spend more time enjoying the beach rather than waiting for deliveries or installations. Therefore, this<strong>4 room apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>not only looks ready; it functions ready.</p><h3>Flexible Layout: One Ready Bedroom, Two Empty Rooms</h3><p>You begin with a head start:<strong>one room is already set as a bedroom</strong>. Meanwhile, the<strong>two empty rooms</strong>hand the design pen to you. For instance, you could establish a quiet<strong>home office</strong>in one and a<strong>guest room</strong>in the other. Alternatively, you might create a<strong>children&rsquo;s room</strong>and a<strong>hobby space</strong>. Because the base finishes remain clean and modern, even minimal furniture looks complete.</p><h3>West-Facing Light and City View</h3><p>Because the apartment<strong>faces west</strong>, the afternoon light grows warm and inviting, and evenings carry that golden hue many residents love. Besides, the<strong>city view</strong>adds a touch of urban energy without sacrificing the ease of beach-side living. Consequently, the atmosphere remains vibrant but not overwhelming&mdash;ideal for both quiet days and social nights.</p><h3>Everyday Comfort: Full Underfloor Heating &amp; Electric Water Heater</h3><p>Underfloor heating covers the entire home. Therefore, winters feel evenly warm without radiators disrupting wall space or your furniture plan. In addition, the electric water heater delivers predictable hot water when you need it. Meanwhile, the visual simplicity of the systems keeps the apartment looking uncluttered, which suits the overall luxury-modern tone.<strong data-start=\"393\" data-end=\"489\">Given its location, this is one of the rare homes in the area to feature underfloor heating,</strong>making it a distinctive choice for year-round comfort.</p><p>Because comfort overlaps with design here, the apartment serves different needs across the year. Consequently, if you plan to live through the cooler months, you&rsquo;ll appreciate the steady warmth; if you plan to rent out in winter, guests will notice and value it.</p><h2>Building &amp; Services: Secure, Connected, Beach-Close</h2><p>Beyond the front door, the building supports daily life with practical inclusions:<strong>near bus stop</strong>,<strong>close to beach</strong>,<strong>cable TV/satellite</strong>,<strong>24/7 camera</strong>coverage, and a<strong>caretaker</strong>who keeps the environment orderly.Therefore, this<strong>4 room apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>brings together location and infrastructure in a way that&rsquo;s simple to live with and easy to manage from abroad.</p><h2>Lifestyle on the West Side: Relaxed, Social, and Walkable</h2><p>Alanya&rsquo;s west side favors a relaxed rhythm while offering plenty to do. You find a blend of locals and international residents that makes the streets feel welcoming. Moreover,<strong>caf&eacute;s and restaurants</strong>line many blocks, so you rarely need to plan ahead to meet friends. Consequently, the neighborhood works well for year-round living, second-home stays, or longer visits.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Promenade:</strong>walk, jog, or cycle with open sea views</p></li><li><p><strong>Beach clubs:</strong>lounge by day, enjoy events or concerts at times</p></li><li><p><strong>Water sports:</strong>choose from a range of activities when you want them</p></li><li><p><strong>Local food:</strong>shop everyday items at nearby markets and pick up fresh produce at the<strong>Hal</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Transport:</strong>buses run frequently, taxis are easy to find, and the<strong>intercity bus station</strong>sits on this side of town</p></li><li><p><strong>Nearby highlights:</strong>the<strong>new marina</strong>,<strong>Ula≈ü Beach</strong>,<strong>Konaklƒ±</strong>, and<strong>Hamaxia</strong>for historical interest</p></li></ul><p>In addition, the layout of the area helps you depend less on a car. Therefore, errands happen on foot, and social plans tend to form naturally. Meanwhile, the<strong>40 m</strong>distance to Cleopatra Beach means you can build a genuine beach routine&mdash;morning dips, sunset walks, or a quick swim between tasks.</p><h2>Investment Angle: High Rental Potential Steps from the Sand</h2><p>From<strong>an investor&rsquo;s perspective</strong>, this 4 room apartment for sale in Alanya has several strengths that stack up:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Proximity to Cleopatra Beach (40 m)</strong>&mdash; location sells itself to guests and tenants</p></li><li><p><strong>West-facing</strong>orientation and<strong>city view</strong>&mdash; appealing light and outlook broaden the audience</p></li><li><p><strong>Flexible 4-room plan</strong>&mdash; suits couples, small families, remote workers, or friends sharing</p></li><li><p><strong>Furnished + white goods</strong>&mdash; faster onboarding for tenants, fewer setup delays</p></li><li><p><strong>Full underfloor heating</strong>&mdash; comfort that increases shoulder-season and winter appeal</p></li></ol><p>Consequently, the property aligns with both short-stay and long-stay strategies. Moreover, the<strong>cash payment &mdash; discount offer</strong>can sharpen your entry price, which improves overall returns.&nbsp;</p><p>If you focus on occupancy, the combination of beach distance, walkable amenities, and simple commuting options matters. Therefore, you position yourself for steady demand in all seasons, not just peak summer weeks.</p><h2>Personalization Without Waste: Two Empty Rooms, Your Call</h2><p><strong>Many buyers prefer to bring in their own furniture choices over time</strong>. Because<strong>two rooms remain empty</strong>, you avoid the cost and effort of removing items you don&rsquo;t need. For instance, you can start with a minimal setup&mdash;desk, chair, and storage&mdash;and grow it as your routine stabilizes. Meanwhile, the finished<strong>bedroom</strong>ensures you sleep comfortably from day one, so you can phase in the rest at your own pace.</p><p>Moreover, the neutral finishes make small additions count: a rug changes the tone, a lamp softens the evening light, and a bookshelf anchors a workspace. Consequently, you reach that &ldquo;lived-in&rdquo; feel quicker, without remodeling.</p><h2>Practical Distances That Change Daily Habits</h2><ul><li><p><strong>40 m to Cleopatra Beach</strong>&mdash; morning swim before breakfast</p></li><li><p><strong>10 m to caf&eacute;s</strong>&mdash; grab a coffee between calls</p></li><li><p><strong>50 m to restaurants</strong>&mdash; choose last-minute dinners without driving</p></li><li><p><strong>70 m to supermarket</strong>&mdash; a short detour on your walk home</p></li></ul><p>In addition, the nearby<strong>bus stop</strong>and easy access to<strong>taxis</strong>keep cross-town trips straightforward. Therefore, you enjoy both a village-like daily radius and simple connectivity when you need it.</p><h2>Legal &amp; Eligibility: Area Open for Residence Permit</h2><p>The<strong>area is open for residence permit</strong>, which simplifies plans for longer stays. Moreover, if you&rsquo;re evaluating different routes, sequencing your documents well makes life easier. Consequently, we can outline the steps, typical timelines, and which papers to prepare first. This clarity helps you move from viewing to move-in without unnecessary pauses.</p><h2>Payment &amp; Offer: Ask About the Cash Discount</h2><p>A<strong>cash payment &mdash; discount offer</strong>is available. Therefore, if you plan to act decisively, ask us for the current figures. We&rsquo;ll share the numbers clearly and provide a simple breakdown so you can compare scenarios. In addition, we can prepare a sample rental projection to help you evaluate return and payback under different occupancy assumptions.</p><h2>Who Would Love This Beautiful Kleopatra Beach Apartment?</h2><ul><li><p>Buyers who want a 4 room apartment for sale in Alanya literally<strong>steps from Cleopatra Beach</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Remote professionals</strong>who value caf&eacute;s, walkable errands, and quick access to public transport</p></li><li><p><strong>Small families or couples</strong>who want a flexible plan with room to grow</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>seeking a well-located unit with strong year-round appeal</p></li></ul><p>Consequently, the layout adapts as your life does. Today&rsquo;s office might become tomorrow&rsquo;s nursery; a guest room can later turn into a hobby space.</p><h2>Why This 4 Room Apartment for Sale in Alanya Stands Out</h2><ul><li><p><strong>40 m</strong>to Cleopatra Beach</p></li><li><p><strong>87 m&sup2;</strong>,<strong>west-facing</strong>,<strong>city view</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>American kitchen</strong>,<strong>furnished</strong>,<strong>white goods included</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Full underfloor heating</strong>,<strong>electric water heater</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Near bus stop</strong>,<strong>cable TV/satellite</strong>,<strong>24/7 camera</strong>,<strong>caretaker</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Area open for residence permit</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>High rental potential</strong>with a<strong>cash discount</strong>opportunity</p></li></ul><p>Therefore, you combine location, comfort, and flexibility in one compact, easy-to-manage package.</p><h2>Work with Luxury Estate Turkey &mdash; From Viewing to Handover and Beyond</h2><p><strong>Choosing the right team matters as much as choosing the right home</strong>.

As a final, luxurious touch, the entire apartment features<strong>underfloor heating</strong>, ensuring comfort and warmth throughout the year.</p><h2>Interior Design &ndash; Contemporary and Elegant</h2><h3>General Atmosphere</h3><p>From the moment you step inside, it&rsquo;s clear that this home has been designed with modern elegance in mind. Light-toned ceramic flooring reflects the daylight streaming in through wide windows, while neutral-colored walls expand the sense of space. The design blends natural wood textures with clean lines, creating a warm yet minimalist ambiance.</p><h3>Living Room &ndash; A Comfortable Social Hub</h3><p>The living room is designed as the central gathering space of the home. A large, L-shaped beige sofa offers plenty of seating for family or guests, and strategically placed lighting fixtures ensure a cozy atmosphere both during the day and in the evening.</p><p>From the living room, you have direct access to the enclosed glass balcony. This area functions as an additional year-round living space, ideal for enjoying breakfast in the morning sun or relaxing with a book in the evening.</p><h3>Kitchen &ndash; Modern and Functional</h3><p>The open American kitchen integrates seamlessly into the living area. It features light wood cabinetry paired with sleek black marble-pattern countertops, creating an eye-catching contrast. Built-in appliances, including an oven, stovetop, and extractor fan, are arranged for maximum efficiency. In addition, a natural wood dining table with woven-style chairs sits between the kitchen and living area, forming a warm and inviting dining space.</p><h3>Bedrooms &ndash; Both Ready and Customizable</h3><p>This apartment&rsquo;s bedroom layout offers a rare advantage: two rooms come unfurnished, giving the buyer the chance to design them freely. Whether you need a home office, guest bedroom, or hobby room, you can shape the space to fit your needs.</p><p>The master bedroom, on the other hand, is fully furnished with a stylish upholstered bed frame, bedside tables, and built-in storage. Soft beige curtains and large windows keep the space bright, while warm wood finishes add a sense of comfort.</p><h3>Bathroom &ndash; Stylish and Well-Equipped</h3><p>The bathroom features contemporary tiling in soft stone shades, modern fixtures, and a spacious walk-in shower. Quality materials ensure durability, while the design keeps the space fresh and elegant.</p><h3>Balcony and Views &ndash; Year-Round Comfort</h3><p>The enclosed glass balcony expands your living area while protecting you from seasonal weather changes. It&rsquo;s large enough to set up as a dining space, a lounge with comfortable chairs, or even a small indoor garden.</p><p>From the balcony, you can enjoy open city views, and on clear days, glimpses of the Taurus Mountains.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>What if your daily routine included the Mediterranean just a short stroll away?</h2><p data-start=\"218\" data-end=\"610\">Kargƒ±cak is one of those places where life naturally slows down. The mornings often begin with a walk by the sea, the afternoons are surrounded by green hills, and evenings are best enjoyed on the balcony with family or friends. What makes the area special is its balance: the beaches are clean, the water is clear and calm enough for swimming or diving, yet the town itself stays peaceful.</p><p data-start=\"612\" data-end=\"1046\">Even though Kargƒ±cak feels like a quiet escape, it&rsquo;s well connected. The center of Alanya is just 20 minutes away by bus, and Gazipa≈üa Airport is only 28 km from here. That means you can enjoy the calm of a coastal town without losing the convenience of being close to the city and easy travel connections. And with the Taurus Mountains framing the background, every view feels like a reminder that nature is right at your doorstep.</p><p data-start=\"1048\" data-end=\"1520\">Within this setting, Monarch Premium brings a modern take on comfortable living. Built on 3,787 m&sup2;, it consists of a single block with 55 thoughtfully designed apartments. The project isn&rsquo;t just about having an address &mdash; it&rsquo;s about joining a community. Families appreciate the safe and well-planned environment, while investors see value in the area&rsquo;s growing appeal. Shared amenities add to daily life, making it easier to relax, exercise, or simply enjoy time at home.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p data-start=\"1522\" data-end=\"1819\">Monarch Premium blends the things that matter most: location, comfort, and quality. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a home by the sea, a holiday apartment, or a smart investment, it offers a lifestyle where everyday life feels a little lighter, a little calmer, and a lot closer to the Mediterranean.</p><h2>A Home in Alanya That Balances Modern Style and Warmth</h2><p>The 110 m&sup2; furnished apartment offers a 3 room layout &mdash; two bedrooms and a spacious living area with an open kitchen. Its interior design follows a modern&ndash;contemporary line, with neutral tones, functional furniture, and subtle luxurious details.</p><p><strong>Color Palette</strong><br />Soft beige, cream, and grey dominate the spaces, creating a calm and timeless atmosphere. Unlike Scandinavian interiors that emphasize light woods, this apartment introduces deeper brown tones and darker cabinetry, giving it a more urban sophistication.</p><p><strong>Furniture</strong><br />The living room centers around a large L-shaped sofa, designed for both relaxation and social gatherings. A streamlined TV unit and functional dining table continue the emphasis on practicality.</p><p><strong>Lighting</strong><br />Golden accents in chandeliers and recessed LED lights add a layer of contemporary elegance. This combination creates warmth without overwhelming the clean lines of the design.</p><p><strong>Accessories and Textiles</strong><br />Dark and light-toned curtains, minimalist wall art, and soft rugs warm up the neutral scheme. Bedrooms use pastel textiles and upholstered headboards, evoking the comfort of a boutique hotel.</p><p><strong>Balcony Lifestyle</strong><br />Furnished with simple yet stylish pieces, the balcony extends the living space outward &mdash; the perfect spot for morning coffee, evening conversations, or simply enjoying the fresh air just 200 meters from the sea.</p><p>The overall result is a home that feels immediately livable: modern, minimal, and slightly luxurious, without slipping into excess.</p><h2>Monarch Premium &ndash; More Than a Residence</h2><p>Life in Monarch Premium is enriched by a wide selection of social facilities that transform everyday routines into enjoyable experiences:</p><ul><li><p>Outdoor and indoor pools with slides</p></li><li><p>Spa amenities including sauna, Turkish bath, massage rooms, and a relaxing lounge</p></li><li><p>Fitness center, tennis court, and basketball court for an active lifestyle</p></li><li><p>Cinema room, caf&eacute;, and game areas for entertainment at home</p></li><li><p>Green landscaped areas, children&rsquo;s pool, and playgrounds for family life</p></li><li><p>Secure lobby, parking garage, caretaker services, and 24/7 camera systems</p></li><li><p>Practical extras such as water purification, generator, bicycle parking, and pavilion spaces</p></li></ul><p>Every element is designed to provide residents with the comforts of a premium community while keeping the Mediterranean just steps away.</p><h2>Kargƒ±cak &ndash; A Setting That Blends Sea, Nature, and Accessibility</h2><p>Kargƒ±cak is often chosen by those who want both relaxation and convenience. Its coastline offers clean, calm waters perfect for swimming and diving. Inland, agricultural fields and mountain landscapes create a backdrop for outdoor activities like hiking, cycling, and horseback riding.</p><p>Daily needs are easily met with local shops, cafes, and family-run restaurants. For broader shopping and nightlife, Mahmutlar is only 2 km away, while Alanya city center is 15 km. Public buses run frequently, ensuring smooth mobility, and both taxis and private transfers are readily available.</p><p>This combination of peaceful daily life, proximity to urban amenities, and strong transport links makes Kargƒ±cak attractive not only for living but also for investment.</p><h2>Who Will Find This Apartment Ideal?</h2><p><strong>Families</strong><br />The 3 room layout, two bathrooms, and extensive on-site facilities like pools, playgrounds, and sports courts make it ideal for family life.</p><p><strong>International Investors</strong><br />Proximity to the sea (200 m), combined with Monarch Premium&rsquo;s rich amenities, ensures strong rental demand from both short-term holidaymakers and long-term tenants. High yield potential is supported by the growing popularity of Kargƒ±cak.</p><p><strong>Couples and Young Professionals</strong><br />The modern d&eacute;cor, ready-to-move-in condition, and access to leisure facilities create a stylish yet practical home base.</p><p><strong>Digital Nomads and Long-Term Residents</strong><br />With reliable infrastructure, a quiet environment, and extensive services within the complex, the apartment supports a balanced lifestyle of work and relaxation year-round.</p><h2>An Investment That Combines Comfort and Value</h2><p>Monarch Premium represents more than a residential choice &mdash; it is a secure investment in one of Alanya&rsquo;s most appealing neighborhoods. The limited number of units, combined with strong demand for modern, seafront-adjacent properties, ensures long-term value appreciation. Investors benefit from both high rental potential and steady capital growth.</p><h2>Working with a Trusted Partner</h2><p>Purchasing property abroad can be complex, but with the right partner, it becomes a straightforward and rewarding process. Luxury Estate Turkey provides:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Local expertise and global understanding</strong>&ndash; insights into Kargƒ±cak and the wider Alanya market</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and logistical support</strong>&ndash; from contracts to residence permits</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored advice</strong>&ndash; matching homes to lifestyle or investment goals</p></li><li><p><strong>After-sales services</strong>&ndash; including rental management, furnishing assistance, and resale guidance</p></li><li><p><strong>Inspection trips</strong>&ndash; helping international buyers experience properties first-hand before making decisions</p></li></ul><p>Our goal is to combine transparency, professionalism, and personalized service, ensuring every client feels secure and satisfied with their purchase.</p><p>This furnished 3 room apartment in Monarch Premium Kargƒ±cak offers a modern interior, a prime location just 200 meters from the sea, and access to resort-level facilities.

    "property_title": "Villa in Alanya with a delightful garden and terrace",
    "property_description": "<div><p>This<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/villas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">villa in Alanya</a>is 160 square meters spread across four floors, and honestly, the layout makes sense in a way most places don&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;re talking 3 bedrooms, 1 living room, and the sea is literally 300 meters away. Not &ldquo;lean out the window and squint&rdquo; sea view &ndash; but a<strong>real sea view</strong>, and still just<strong>walking distance to the beach</strong>. If you&rsquo;re looking for villa for sale in Alanya, this one balances comfort and location perfectly.</p><p>The ground floor has this big kitchen that opens to a terrace. Not some tiny balcony where we can barely fit a chair, but proper outdoor space where we can actually cook and eat outside. The entry level gives us a bedroom and bathroom &ndash; perfect when parents visit or when we want guests to have their own space without trekking upstairs.</p><p>First floor is where we&rsquo;d spend most of our time: living room plus an enclosed balcony. Second floor has another bedroom facing east, so morning light without the afternoon heat beating down. There&rsquo;s a bathroom up there too, and another balcony. Top floor? Extra bedroom and balcony. Three balconies total, which sounds excessive until we realize each one catches different light throughout the day.</p><h2>Villa Facilities and Modern Comfort</h2><p>The building itself has the basics covered: open pool, private parking (huge plus in this area), 24/7 security cameras, and a backup generator for when the power goes out. There&rsquo;s also a gym, sauna, Turkish bath, and tennis court. Let&rsquo;s be honest &ndash; most of us will use the pool and parking more than anything else, but the full set of amenities boosts both lifestyle and Alanya villa prices in the long run.</p><p>The villa comes furnished with white goods included. PVC windows, steel entrance door, ceramic floors, proper shower cabin, decent bathroom fixtures. American-style open kitchen, panel doors throughout. Standard stuff, but done right &ndash; exactly what people expect from a villa in Alanya near beach.</p><h2>This Villa with Sea View in Alanya Offers Spacious Terrace and Garden Life</h2><h3>Terraces and Garden</h3><p>Too often in this region, villas have beautiful interiors but forget that people want to live outside half the year &ndash; especially in Alanya, which enjoys more than 300 days of sunshine a year. Here, the terraces and garden are the main act, not an afterthought.</p><ul><li>The ground-floor terrace is shaded, large enough for dining and lounging.</li><li>The garden is just the right size &mdash; green without being overwhelming.</li><li>The pool is steps away, part of everyday living.</li></ul><p>A couple of citrus trees, some bougainvillea climbing the wall, maybe a small herb patch &mdash; and suddenly it feels like a real Alanya home. Imagine evening barbecues, barefoot kids, and that faint salt smell drifting in from the sea.</p><h2>This Villa&rsquo;s in Kestel, Alanya &mdash; What the Area&rsquo;s Really Like</h2><p>Kestel sits between Mahmutlar and Tosmur, about 15 minutes from Alanya center. Close enough to grab groceries or hit the market, far enough that we&rsquo;re not dealing with tourist crowds every day. Quieter beaches, calmer streets, and a lifestyle that feels more local and less tourist circus make this area highly attractive. Public buses run along the coastal road, taxis wait on every corner &mdash; getting around is never an issue.</p><p>Life here is simple: swim in the Mediterranean, cycle along the coastal bike path all the way to Alanya center, or take a quick trip to the Dim&ccedil;ay River Valley for some weekend cool-down. Need more shopping? A short ride brings you to Mahmutlar or downtown. Caf&eacute;s, bakeries, supermarkets, and local restaurants line the streets, while fresh fish restaurants by the beach let you enjoy dinner with an unbeatable sea view. It has everything you need &mdash; from your morning bread at the local bakery to your groceries at Migros or Carrefour.</p><p>In recent years, Kestel has turned into a<strong>true international mix</strong>. It&rsquo;s become especially popular among foreigners looking for a quieter lifestyle, without losing access to the city buzz. That balance is exactly why<strong>Kestel villa prices</strong>keep increasing year after year.</p><h2>Investment Potential &mdash; Why This Villa in Alanya Stands Out?</h2><p><strong>And investors, listen up:</strong>With<strong>Alanya Alaaddin Keykubat University</strong>right in Kestel, new residents and students keep flowing in. Add to that the international demand, and you&rsquo;ve got a hotspot where new buildings keep rising and value keeps growing. In short: this is not just a home, but a smart long-term investment. If you&rsquo;re searching for<strong>Alanya sea view villa for sale</strong>, you&rsquo;re also securing a profitable opportunity in a market that&rsquo;s still growing.</p><p><strong>No wonder our<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luxury Estate Turkey</a>office is right here, in the heart of Kestel. We like to stay close to the action.</strong></p><h2><strong>Why Work with Luxury Estate Turkey?</strong></h2><p>Buying property abroad isn&rsquo;t just another purchase &ndash; it&rsquo;s one of those life-changing decisions. That&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;re here. We&rsquo;re not just about selling you four walls and a roof.<strong>We&rsquo;re about being the people you can actually trust when everything feels overwhelming.</strong></p><h3>Honest Guidance</h3><p>We don&rsquo;t do complicated sales pitches or hidden agendas. We&rsquo;ll tell you exactly how things work, what to expect, and yes, even when something might not be the best fit for you. Because real trust starts with honest conversations.</p><h3>Paperwork and Legal Assistance</h3><p>Title deeds, tax numbers, permits &ndash; all that stuff that sounds important but feels impossible? That&rsquo;s our job. We&rsquo;ve done this hundreds of times, so while you&rsquo;re dreaming about your new villa in Alanya, we&rsquo;re making sure every &ldquo;i&rdquo; is dotted and every &ldquo;t&rdquo; is crossed.</p><h3>Turkish Citizenship &amp; Residence Support</h3><p><strong>Thinking about Turkish citizenship or residence permit?</strong>We&rsquo;ve walked so many people through this process.

We speak your language, we know Turkey inside and out, and we make sure you feel confident about your decision &ndash; not stressed and confused.</p><p>Want to see this<strong>villa in Alanya really close to sea</strong>&nbsp;with your own eyes?

And here&rsquo;s our favorite part &ndash; if you&rsquo;re ever in the area, come by our office! We&rsquo;ll brew some proper Turkish coffee, sit down like old friends, and talk through all the details.</p><p>Have you heard about our inspection trip program?<strong>We actually cover your travel expenses!</strong>You get to see multiple properties, explore the area, and make your decision with complete confidence. Reach out to us for all the details on what this program includes!</p></div>",

    "property_description": "<div><h2><span data-start=\"242\" data-end=\"317\">Seafront 3-Room Apartment for sale in Tosmur&nbsp;</span></h2><p data-start=\"293\" data-end=\"723\">Waking up to the gentle rhythm of the waves and watching the sun set behind the historic Alanya Castle is not just a holiday dream&mdash;it can be your everyday reality. This<strong data-start=\"462\" data-end=\"504\">seafront and<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/apartments/sea-view\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">sea view apartment in Alanya</a></strong>sits Tosmur district- directly on the shoreline, offering an uninterrupted front-row view of the Mediterranean&rsquo;s endless blue and the timeless silhouette of the castle. Every glance from your windows feels like looking at a postcard.</p><p data-start=\"725\" data-end=\"1108\">One of the home&rsquo;s most remarkable features is its<strong data-start=\"775\" data-end=\"800\">dedicated view corner</strong>&mdash;a thoughtfully designed nook by the large panoramic windows, where you can sip your morning coffee, read a book, or simply lose yourself in the scenery. Whether it&rsquo;s the golden glow of sunrise, the sparkling midday sea, or the fiery colors of sunset, this cozy corner turns each moment into an experience.</p><p data-start=\"1110\" data-end=\"1391\">Recently renovated and fully furnished, the apartment seamlessly blends modern Mediterranean elegance with minimalist comfort, creating a warm and inviting space that complements the breathtaking views outside. Here, the sea isn&rsquo;t just part of the landscape&mdash;it&rsquo;s part of your life.</p><h2>Interior Design</h2><p>Step inside, and you are welcomed by a spacious open-plan living and dining area where every design choice maximizes space, light, and comfort. The flooring is finished with glossy grey marble-effect tiles, reflecting sunlight and enhancing the sense of openness.</p><p>The living room follows a<strong>minimalist luxury</strong>approach: a white and cream sofa set with soft curves replaces sharp edges, creating a soothing visual flow. A round coffee table sits at the center, complementing the organic shapes of the furniture. Along one wall, a blue marble-patterned decorative panel introduces a<strong>modern Mediterranean</strong>touch, evoking the colors of the sea. The sleek TV unit stretches across the wall without unnecessary bulk, keeping the atmosphere uncluttered.</p><p>Adjacent to the windows, two custom-designed armchairs in soft blue shades form a charming coffee corner with a small round table&mdash;an ideal spot for morning espressos or evening wine while gazing at the horizon.</p><p>The dining area features a round wooden table surrounded by fabric-upholstered chairs. Positioned near the windows, it allows you to enjoy the view with every meal. The table is already set, adding a &ldquo;lived-in&rdquo; feel that helps potential buyers envision themselves here.</p><h3>Kitchen &ndash; A Functional and Stylish Hub</h3><p>The kitchen blends classic and modern aesthetics: white lacquered cabinets with rustic handles, granite countertops for durability, and open shelves for personalized d&eacute;cor. The L-shaped layout maximizes workspace and keeps the area connected to the living room without being fully open, offering both convenience and a degree of separation.</p><h3>Bedrooms &ndash; Warm and Inviting</h3><p>The bedrooms embrace<strong>rustic touches</strong>through natural wood textures and wardrobe doors with mesh-style panels, combining industrial and cozy vibes. Wall panels and soft-toned wallpaper add personality while maintaining a relaxing ambiance.</p><h2>Imagine Living in This Sea-View Apartment in Alanya</h2><p>Here, life moves to the rhythm of the sea. Imagine starting your mornings with the sound of waves and your first coffee in the bay window corner, watching the sunlight dance on the water. Evenings become a ritual of watching the sun set behind Alanya Castle from your own living room.</p><p>The open and airy layout is perfect for family living or hosting guests. The carefully selected furniture and color scheme offer a timeless elegance that will not feel outdated in years to come.</p><p>Moreover, the year-round Mediterranean climate ensures that you can enjoy both your interior and outdoor spaces in every season.</p><h2>Location &ndash; Tosmur&rsquo;s Perfect Balance of Nature and Convenience</h2><p data-start=\"241\" data-end=\"553\">Tosmur isn&rsquo;t the kind of place you just pass through&mdash;it&rsquo;s the kind of place that slows you down without you noticing. Sitting just east of Alanya&rsquo;s centre, it feels close enough to the city to keep life convenient, yet far enough that the soundtrack is more about the sea and the rustle of leaves than traffic.</p><p data-start=\"555\" data-end=\"976\">One of Tosmur&rsquo;s little treasures is the<strong data-start=\"595\" data-end=\"611\">Dim&ccedil;ay River</strong>, where icy mountain water winds its way to the Mediterranean. On summer afternoons, locals and visitors gather in riverside caf&eacute;s, dipping their feet in the cool stream, lingering over grilled fish, or simply watching the water rush by. You&rsquo;ll also find shaded picnic spots and even a small go-kart track for when you want a dose of adrenaline with your weekend.</p><p data-start=\"978\" data-end=\"1352\">Daily life here is easy. A quick stroll takes you to the butcher, the greengrocer, the bakery with its warm bread smell spilling onto the street. Once a week, the<strong data-start=\"1141\" data-end=\"1160\">Thursday market</strong>transforms the neighbourhood into a burst of colour&mdash;heaping stalls of fresh fruit, fragrant spices, olives, cheeses, and the occasional vendor calling out special deals in a singsong voice.</p><p data-start=\"1354\" data-end=\"1718\">You don&rsquo;t need a car to enjoy Tosmur. Buses stop on almost every corner, connecting you to Alanya&rsquo;s centre, or to nearby Kestel, Oba, and Cikcilli in just minutes. And when you&rsquo;re not travelling, you&rsquo;ll probably find yourself choosing between a casual dinner in a family-run lokanta or trying one of the caf&eacute;s serving international dishes with a view of the sea.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p data-start=\"1720\" data-end=\"1993\">For nature lovers, Tosmur offers more than just its shoreline. It&rsquo;s framed by gentle green hills and lies within a short drive of<strong data-start=\"1850\" data-end=\"1862\">Dim Cave</strong>, one of Turkey&rsquo;s largest public caves, where cool air and dramatic rock formations create a completely different kind of escape.</p><h2>Social and Building Features for Residents</h2><p>Residents benefit from a well-maintained complex with:</p><ul><li><p><strong>24/7 security cameras</strong>ensuring peace of mind</p></li><li><p><strong>Caretaker services</strong>for daily maintenance</p></li><li><p><strong>Cable TV-satellite infrastructure</strong></p></li><li><p>Direct<strong>beach access</strong>thanks to the front-line location</p></li><li><p>Proximity to<strong>public transport</strong>and urban facilities</p></li></ul><h2>For Investors:</h2><h3>Investment Potential &ndash; High Rental Returns and Year-Round Demand</h3><p>This apartment&rsquo;s location, size, and features make it a highly attractive option for both short-term holiday rentals and long-term leasing. Tosmur&rsquo;s popularity among foreign buyers ensures consistent demand, while the seafront position adds premium value.</p><p>The renovated interiors mean minimal initial investment&mdash;buyers can start renting immediately if desired. Given the property&rsquo;s size and views, it holds strong appreciation potential over the coming years.</p><h2>Why Choose Luxury Estate Turkey? &ndash; Your Reliable Real Estate Partner in Turkey</h2><p>Buying property in a foreign country requires trust, expertise, and support.
