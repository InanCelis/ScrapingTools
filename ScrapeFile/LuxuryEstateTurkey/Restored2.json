    "property_title": "Ultra Luxury Villa Infinity with Wellness & Panoramic View in Alanya",
    "property_description": "<div><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">When people talk about<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/luxury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">luxury real estate in Alanya</a>, they usually mention square meters and amenities. But how do you put a price on the moment your shoulders drop and your breathing slows just because you stepped onto your terrace? That's the kind of luxury that doesn't show up in property listings &ndash; the luxury of coming home to peace- a kind of luxury that also qualifies you for<strong>Turkish citizenship.</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Picture this: You wake up, pad barefoot to your kitchen, and while your coffee brews, you're looking out at the ancient Alanya Castle sitting proudly on its cliff, the endless blue sea stretching to the horizon, mountains rising like sleeping giants in the distance. This isn't a vacation moment you'll treasure forever &ndash; this is just Tuesday morning at your new sea view property in Alanya.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">But let's flip the script for a moment. Forget the morning coffee &ndash; let's talk about coming home after a long day. You pull into your private parking, take the elevator up to your sea view home in Alanya, and suddenly the stress of the day just melts away. Why?<strong>Because you're watching one of the most spectacular light shows on earth unfold right in front of you.</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">As the sun sets, Alanya Castle transforms from ancient stone to a glowing beacon, its lights reflecting off the water like scattered diamonds. You can see the little houses clustered around the castle hill starting to twinkle to life &ndash; windows lighting up one by one as families settle in for the evening, the warm glow of homes creating a constellation against the darkening hillside. And above it all, the moon begins its slow climb across the sky, casting silver paths across the water that seem to lead straight to your balcony.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>This isn't just a view you admire &ndash; it's therapy you live with every single evening.</strong></p><p>Standing proud on 600m&sup2; of carefully planned land, this 525m&sup2; architectural masterpiece rises through four thoughtfully designed floors. But calling it a house feels almost insulting to what it truly represents. This is your private resort, your wellness sanctuary, your entertainment hub, and your peaceful retreat all wrapped into one extraordinary address.</p><p>The moment you step inside, the distinction between indoor and outdoor living dissolves completely. Floor-to-ceiling glass walls don't just frame views &ndash; they invite the Mediterranean landscape to become part of your daily life. Dark and light grey stone cladding gives the exterior a sophisticated strength that commands respect, while the interior's palette of whites, creams, and soft greys creates an atmosphere that breathes tranquility into every corner.</p><h2>Villa Infinity brings you sea view in Alanya along with the benefit of Turkish citizenship eligibility</h2><p data-start=\"458\" data-end=\"749\">Here&rsquo;s where Villa Infinity transforms from a beautiful home into a life-changing investment. This property is fully eligible for the<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/blog/types-of-passports-in-turkey-and-the-advantages-of-turkish-citizenship-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkish Citizenship by Investment program</a>, giving you and your family the right to secure a new future in Turkey with all the privileges that come with it.</p><p data-start=\"751\" data-end=\"1216\">And Turkish citizenship means more than just holding a new passport. It offers security in a stable country, access to quality healthcare and education, and the chance to establish your life in a vibrant Mediterranean city. For investors, it creates a foundation for long-term returns, while for families it guarantees a safe and welcoming environment to call home. Villa Infinity is therefore not only a residence, but a direct path to a stronger and more certain future.</p><h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\">Architectural Character &amp; Exterior</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This striking villa makes a bold first impression with its sophisticated blend of dark and light grey stone cladding that creates a powerful, contemporary presence. The extensive use of floor-to-ceiling glass panels and sleek glass railings doesn't just bring a modern edge &ndash; it frames the surrounding landscape like a living artwork, making the views an integral part of the home's design story.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The architectural language speaks of understated luxury, where every material choice has been carefully considered to create a sense of permanence and elegance that will age gracefully over time.</p><h2>Interior Palette &amp; Atmosphere</h2><p>Step inside, and you're immediately embraced by a carefully curated color story that feels both fresh and timeless. The interior palette revolves around crisp whites, warm creams, soft beiges, and sophisticated greys &ndash; a combination that breathes serenity into every corner while maintaining an air of refined elegance. This isn't just decoration; it's the foundation of a lifestyle that values calm sophistication over fleeting trends.</p><p>The overall effect is one of spacious tranquility, where natural light dances across neutral surfaces, creating an ever-changing canvas of subtle shadows and highlights throughout the day.</p><h2>Living &amp; Social Spaces</h2><p>The heart of the home showcases stunning white marble-effect flooring with clean, linear patterns that immediately evoke the luxury of a five-star hotel. But this isn't cold or intimidating &ndash; quite the opposite. The flooring serves as a beautiful backdrop for carefully selected furniture pieces that prioritize both comfort and contemporary style.</p><p>The seating areas feature plush, rounded-edge sofas and chairs with soft textures that invite you to sink in and stay awhile. These aren't just beautiful pieces &ndash; they're designed for real living, real conversations, real moments with family and friends.</p><p>Above, dramatic spherical pendant lights and strategically placed LED recessed lighting create layers of illumination that can shift the mood from bright and energizing during the day to intimate and cozy in the evening. The lighting design doesn't just illuminate spaces; it sculpts them, adding depth and drama to every gathering.</p><h2>Dining &amp; Kitchen Experience</h2><p>The dining area centers around an elegant oval white table surrounded by minimalist chairs that capture the essence of Scandinavian modern design &ndash; clean, functional, and effortlessly stylish. This isn't formal dining that intimidates; it's a space that welcomes both intimate family meals and larger gatherings with equal grace.</p><p>The kitchen island and accompanying bar stools transform cooking from a chore into a social experience. Whether you're preparing a quiet breakfast or hosting a dinner party, the design encourages interaction and connection. The thoughtful integration of warm wood cladding against the predominantly white surfaces adds just the right amount of natural warmth, preventing the space from feeling stark or cold.</p><p>This is a kitchen designed for real life &ndash; beautiful enough for entertaining, practical enough for everyday living.</p><h2>Private Retreats</h2><p>The bedrooms continue the hotel-inspired luxury theme, with carefully selected headboards and linens that create an immediate sense of refined comfort. These aren't just places to sleep &ndash; they're personal sanctuaries designed for true rest and rejuvenation.</p><p>The master suite takes luxury to the next level with a bathtub elegantly integrated into the bedroom space itself. This bold design choice creates an immediate spa-like atmosphere, blurring the lines between sleeping, bathing, and relaxation into one seamless experience of personal indulgence.</p><h2>Wellness &amp; Mindfulness</h2><p>Perhaps most uniquely, the villa features a dedicated wellness room that serves as a yoga and meditation sanctuary. Large mirrors amplify the natural light and sense of space, while a golden-toned Buddha statue provides a focal point for contemplation.
