    "property_description": "<div><h2>A Residence in Alanya That Puts You Steps Away from Cleopatra Beach</h2><p>When people search for property in Alanya, the first names that come up are usually Mahmutlar, Kestel, or Oba. These districts are indeed popular, but nothing compares to living within walking distance of<strong>Cleopatra Beach</strong>&mdash; the most famous stretch of sand on Turkey&rsquo;s southern coast. In this neighborhood, the sea, the city, and the lifestyle all come together.</p><p>Believe us, Cleopatra Beach was not named after Cleopatra for nothing! Here,<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/blog/live-like-a-queen-properties-near-cleopatra-beach-alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">you can live like a queen</a>!</p><p>Within this setting,<strong>Cleopatra Saray 13</strong>offers a<strong>2 room apartment of 45 m&sup2;</strong>, completed in<strong>2023</strong>and now available as a<strong>resale unit</strong>. It sits just<strong>400 meters from the beach</strong>, oriented toward the northwest, and designed for both comfort and practicality.</p><h2>Apartment Interior and Layout</h2><p>Though compact in size, the apartment uses its<strong>45 m&sup2;</strong>efficiently. The open-plan living area connects the kitchen and the lounge, creating a sociable environment. Wide windows allow natural light throughout the day, while the<strong>northwest orientation</strong>keeps the interior cooler during summer months &mdash; a detail many buyers appreciate in Alanya&rsquo;s warm climate.</p><p>The<strong>bedroom</strong>offers enough space for built-in wardrobes and a comfortable bed setup, while the bathroom comes with a<strong>modern shower cabin and electric water heater</strong>. Tile flooring, neutral wall finishes, and practical layouts ensure the home can easily be personalized with your own furniture and decoration.</p><p>This property comes as a<strong>resale unit</strong>yet feels brand new, thanks to its recent construction in 2023.</p><h2>Facilities Within Cleopatra Saray 13</h2><p>The residence reflects the<strong>modern living concept of Alanya&rsquo;s city center</strong>. While apartments near Cleopatra Beach often belong to older buildings, Saray 13 delivers a fresh and complete complex atmosphere.</p><p>Facilities include:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Outdoor swimming pool</strong>for warm summer days</p></li><li><p><strong>Jacuzzi and sauna</strong>for relaxation</p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness room</strong>to maintain a healthy routine</p></li><li><p><strong>Barbecue area</strong>for social gatherings</p></li><li><p><strong>Caretaker service</strong>for daily maintenance</p></li><li><p><strong>24/7 camera system</strong>ensuring security</p></li><li><p><strong>Cable TV and satellite infrastructure</strong></p></li></ul><p>These communal features add value to the property and make it appealing not only for living but also for rental purposes.</p><h2>Location Advantages &mdash; The Heart of Alanya&rsquo;s Western Side</h2><p>The western side of Alanya combines a<strong>relaxed lifestyle with strong urban amenities</strong>. Streets are lined with cafes, restaurants, and international shops, yet the vibe remains easy-going. You will find neighbors from many different countries, creating a welcoming and multicultural atmosphere.</p><p>The highlight is, of course,<strong>Cleopatra Beach</strong>, stretching for kilometers and offering every type of activity:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Water sports</strong>such as jet skiing, parasailing, and paddleboarding</p></li><li><p><strong>Beach clubs</strong>with concerts, events, and lively nightlife</p></li><li><p><strong>Cycling and walking paths</strong>along the coastline</p></li><li><p><strong>Local markets and fish restaurants</strong>, perfect for fresh produce and seafood</p></li></ul><p>Public transport connections are excellent. The district has<strong>one of the richest bus networks in Alanya</strong>, and taxis are always available on main streets. The<strong>intercity bus terminal</strong>is also nearby, making weekend trips to Antalya or Gazipaşa easy.</p><p>In addition to the beach, you have<strong>New Marina, Ulaş Beach, Konaklı</strong>, and even the<strong>ancient city of Hamaxia</strong>just a few kilometers away. Whether you prefer history, adventure, or simply relaxing by the sea, the area delivers it all.</p><h2>Lifestyle in Cleopatra District</h2><p>Living in Cleopatra means combining<strong>touristic vibrancy with everyday practicality</strong>. You can walk to supermarkets, bakeries, and the central bazaar for daily needs, or explore stylish cafes for a more social lifestyle. The area also features<strong>Alanya&rsquo;s Olympic indoor swimming pool</strong>, sports facilities, and countless restaurants offering both local and international cuisines.</p><p>The neighborhood balances local character with modern convenience, making it attractive not only for tourists but also for year-round residents.</p><h2>Investment Potential and Rental Income</h2><p>Buying an apartment near<strong>Cleopatra Beach</strong>is always a solid investment. Properties in this area have a<strong>high rental potential</strong>, especially during the summer months when demand from international tourists peaks.</p><p>Short-term rentals bring strong returns thanks to the location, while long-term rentals attract digital nomads, couples, or retirees who prefer to live in central Alanya. The fact that the<strong>district remains open for residence permit applications</strong>further increases its appeal to foreign buyers seeking a legal stay in Turkey.</p><p>As a<strong>resale unit</strong>, this property is available for<strong>cash purchase with possible discount options</strong>, offering value compared to new projects that often come at higher prices.</p><h2>Who Should Consider This Apartment?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>: Strong short-term rental demand ensures solid returns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Young professionals or couples</strong>: A practical city apartment within walking distance of the beach and all amenities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retirees</strong>: Comfortable size, easy maintenance, and central location without the need for a car.</p></li></ul><p>The<strong>hotsale listing</strong>makes it an attractive opportunity for anyone seeking to secure a place near Cleopatra Beach quickly.</p><h2>Why Work with Luxury Estate Turkey?</h2><p>Buying property in a foreign country can feel overwhelming.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>Furnished 3 Room Apartment for Sale in Mahmutlar &ndash; 115 m&sup2; with Separate Kitchen and Family-Oriented Design</h2><p>If you are searching for a spacious and well-planned<strong>apartment for sale in Alanya Mahmutlar</strong>, this 115 m&sup2; furnished flat offers a perfect blend of comfort, functionality, and warm interior touches. With a separate kitchen, a fully enclosed balcony, and a classical yet cozy decoration style, the property suits families, long-term residents, and investors who want a ready-to-move option in one of Alanya&rsquo;s most popular districts.</p><h2>Mahmutlar &ndash; A Balanced District Between Local Living and Tourism</h2><p>Mahmutlar is a district that stretches along the Mediterranean coastline, framed by sandy beaches on one side and the foothills of the Taurus Mountains on the other. This duality gives the neighborhood a distinctive atmosphere: the calm of nature meets the vibrancy of a modern residential town. Located only 10 km from Alanya city center, Mahmutlar combines everyday convenience with a holiday spirit.</p><p>Moreover, the district has developed into an expat-friendly community where international residents live side by side with locals. You will find foreign-owned cafes, family-run Turkish restaurants, and international chains all within walking distance. Salı Pazarı (the Tuesday market) is a highlight, offering fresh fruits, vegetables, spices, and traditional textiles every week.</p><p>Transportation is easy and frequent. Local minibuses circulate within Mahmutlar and towards Kargıcak, while buses to Alanya center depart every 10 minutes. Taxis are readily available on every corner. For shopping, residents enjoy Yekta Mall and Akdeniz Park shopping centers, while small butchers, bakeries, and hardware stores cover daily needs across the district.</p><p>Furthermore, Mahmutlar offers a lifestyle tailored to both leisure and activity. The beachfront is perfect for swimming and water sports, while the mountains at the back invite you for hiking, cycling, or weekend picnics. Fitness centers, hamams, and yoga studios add to the variety, making the area equally suitable for retirees, digital nomads, and families with children.</p><h2>Apartment Layout &ndash; Spacious, Functional, and Full of Light</h2><p>This<strong>3 room apartment in Mahmutlar</strong>spans 115 m&sup2;, which provides a larger footprint than the typical properties in the area. The layout emphasizes family living with clearly defined zones:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Living Room:</strong>A welcoming space decorated with beige and brown sofas arranged in a comfortable, family-friendly setup. A glass-topped coffee table with golden details adds elegance, while the TV unit, combining white and wood, creates a practical focal point. The yellow accent wall not only brings warmth but also balances the neutral tones of the furniture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kitchen:</strong>Unlike many newer builds, this property comes with a separate kitchen&mdash;an advantage for buyers who prefer to keep cooking and living spaces apart. Cabinets combine classical brown frames with white doors, while the marble-effect countertop ensures durability and style. Decorative textiles and small details give the kitchen a homely atmosphere.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bedrooms:</strong>The master bedroom follows a calm pastel palette, with a classical bedframe, matching headboard, and nightstands. The second bedroom is arranged more minimally with a single bed and white furniture, making it suitable for a child, guest, or even a home office setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Balcony:</strong>A highlight of this apartment is the large enclosed balcony. Glazed from floor to ceiling, it can be used year-round as a winter garden. Currently arranged with a swing, sofa, and table, the balcony doubles as an extra living area where families can enjoy tea in the evenings or quiet breakfasts on sunny mornings.</p></li></ul><p>In total, the design combines traditional comfort with modern practicality. The choice of textiles, carpets, and curtains reflects Turkish home culture, but the overall look remains adaptable. With small updates&mdash;such as lighter rugs or modern lighting fixtures&mdash;the interior can be easily refreshed to match contemporary tastes.</p><h2>Complex Facilities &ndash; Everyday Comfort at Your Doorstep</h2><p>The residence provides a safe and well-maintained environment with features designed for both relaxation and daily needs.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Outdoor Pool:</strong>A central pool where residents can swim, sunbathe, or enjoy social moments during the long summer season.</p></li><li><p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Pool and Garden:</strong>Families benefit from safe play areas and green spaces for outdoor activities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Barbecue Zone:</strong>Perfect for weekend gatherings with friends and neighbors.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caretaker Services:</strong>A resident caretaker ensures maintenance, cleanliness, and security throughout the year.</p></li><li><p><strong>24/7 Camera System:</strong>Adds an extra layer of safety for peace of mind.</p></li><li><p><strong>Elevator and Parking:</strong>Daily practicality is guaranteed, whether you live here permanently or visit seasonally.</p></li></ul><p>Consequently, the complex functions like a small community where neighbors know each other and social facilities enhance daily living.</p><h2>Location Advantages &ndash; Accessibility and Lifestyle Combined</h2><p>Living in this Mahmutlar apartment means you have beaches, cafes, and shops all within walking distance. The sea is just a short stroll away, giving residents daily access to the Mediterranean coast. Meanwhile, bus connections bring you to Alanya center in less than 15 minutes, making it easy to enjoy both the city&rsquo;s lively atmosphere and Mahmutlar&rsquo;s calm environment.</p><p>Additionally, the proximity to Kargıcak and Kestel expands your lifestyle options. Kargıcak is known for its greener, quieter atmosphere, while Kestel offers riverside walks and quick routes into Alanya University area.</p><h2>Investment Potential &ndash; Rental Income and Long-Term Value</h2><p>This furnished<strong>3 room apartment in Mahmutlar</strong>presents a smart investment for several reasons:</p><ol><li><p><strong>High Rental Demand:</strong>Mahmutlar remains one of the top districts for foreign tenants seeking long-term rentals. Its expat community, international schools, and proximity to the sea ensure year-round occupancy.</p></li><li><p><strong>Short-Term Holiday Rentals:</strong>The enclosed balcony, large size, and family-oriented design appeal to seasonal tourists who prefer apartment stays over hotels.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resale Value:</strong>With its separate kitchen and 115 m&sup2; size, the property stands out from smaller, newer builds. This uniqueness helps preserve long-term value.</p></li><li><p><strong>Citizenship &amp; Residence Permit Eligibility:</strong>Depending on purchase price and legal framework, the property can support Turkish residence permits or, in combined investments, citizenship applications&mdash;an attractive option for foreign buyers.</p></li></ol><p>Therefore, whether your focus is rental income, capital appreciation, or a personal residence, this apartment checks all the boxes.</p><h2>Who Will Enjoy This Apartment Most?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Families:</strong>The spacious rooms, separate kitchen, and secure complex make it ideal for raising children.</p></li><li><p><strong>Retirees:</strong>The calm atmosphere of Mahmutlar, easy access to shops, and year-round balcony comfort create a stress-free lifestyle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Digital Nomads:</strong>With good internet infrastructure and cafes nearby, remote workers can balance work and leisure in an inspiring Mediterranean setting.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors:</strong>The property&rsquo;s size, facilities, and location guarantee high liquidity and profitability in both short and long term.</p></li></ul><h2>Why Choose Luxury Estate Turkey as Your Trusted Partner?</h2><p>Buying property abroad requires not just finding the right home, but also navigating paperwork, cultural differences, and long-term planning.<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luxury Estate Turkey</a>provides the professional guidance and security every buyer deserves.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s what you can expect from our team:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transparent Advice:</strong>We set realistic expectations and guide you honestly about the market, pricing, and potential.</p></li><li><p><strong>Local Expertise:</strong>With years of experience in the Alanya region, we know the neighborhoods, legal frameworks, and investment trends inside out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Full Legal &amp; Logistical Support:</strong>From title deed transfer to residence permit or citizenship procedures, our multilingual team handles the details for you.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sale Services:</strong>We stay connected after your purchase, assisting with furnishing, rentals, bill payments, and property management.</p></li><li><p><strong>Creative Solutions:</strong>Trade-in options, inspection trips, and personalized property tours make your journey smoother.</p></li></ul><p>Ultimately, working with us means you invest securely, avoid common pitfalls, and maximize both lifestyle and profitability.</p><h3>Final Thoughts &ndash; A Spacious and Warm Home in Mahmutlar</h3><p>This<strong>furnished 3 room apartment for sale in Mahmutlar</strong>represents a rare opportunity: 115 m&sup2; of space, a separate kitchen, an enclosed balcony, and a welcoming interior ready for family life.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>What would it mean if your daily walk to the beach took less time than making a morning coffee?</h2><p>In Alanya&rsquo;s Oba neighborhood, opportunities to live this close to the sea are increasingly rare. Hotels and older developments dominate the shoreline, while new projects usually rise several streets away. Yet here is a home that breaks the pattern: a<strong>3 room, 100 m&sup2; apartment just 100 meters from the water</strong>, fully furnished and ready to move in.</p><p>For anyone searching for a property that balances convenience, comfort, and investment sense, this apartment represents a chance to claim both lifestyle and value in one of Alanya&rsquo;s most desirable areas.</p><h2>Interiors Prepared for Effortless Living</h2><p>Stepping inside, the first impression is ease. The apartment comes fully furnished, including all essential white goods, which means new owners can settle in immediately without the hassle of furnishing from scratch.</p><p>The living room forms the heart of the home, offering a bright and welcoming space large enough for family gatherings or relaxed evenings. Two bedrooms complete the layout, each with proportions suitable for long-term living or guest accommodation.</p><p>The presence of an<strong>electric water heater</strong>ensures modern practicality, while neutral finishes provide a versatile backdrop that adapts easily to different d&eacute;cor styles. Whether furnished for a family, a couple, or as a rental unit, the apartment offers flexibility and immediate usability.</p><h2>Complex Features That Add Everyday Value</h2><p>Beyond the apartment itself, the residential complex enhances daily life through a mix of social and practical facilities.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Swimming Pool</strong>&ndash; A refreshing retreat during Alanya&rsquo;s warm summers, right within the complex.</p></li><li><p><strong>Barbecue Area</strong>&ndash; Perfect for weekend gatherings and informal socializing with neighbors.</p></li><li><p><strong>24/7 Camera Systems and Caretaker Services</strong>&ndash; Security and order are maintained around the clock.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parking Spaces</strong>&ndash; A key convenience for residents with vehicles.</p></li></ul><p>These features transform the property from a simple living space into a lifestyle setting. For families, retirees, or tenants, such amenities create an environment where comfort and safety are a given.</p><h2>Oba &ndash; A Neighborhood Where Life Flows Smoothly</h2><p>This apartment&rsquo;s location is not just close to the sea; it is embedded in one of Alanya&rsquo;s most practical and enjoyable neighborhoods.</p><p>Oba is celebrated for its wide sandy beach and pedestrian-friendly promenade lined with palm trees. Here, residents enjoy the freedom to walk or cycle along the coast, stop at a caf&eacute;, or explore weekly street markets that bring the energy of a bazaar into everyday life. Mondays and Thursdays host these colorful markets, where everything from fresh fruit and vegetables to clothing and cosmetics can be found.</p><p>Moreover, Oba&rsquo;s transport links are exceptionally strong. Nearly every bus line connecting Alanya&rsquo;s neighborhoods passes through Oba, making it effortless to reach the city center or nearby areas like Tosmur, Kestel, and Mahmutlar. Essential services are also at hand, including supermarkets, restaurants of every variety, and Alanya Training and Research Hospital, which is located right in Oba.</p><p>In short, living here means combining seaside leisure with practical convenience in a way few other areas manage.</p><h2>Who Will Find This Apartment Ideal?</h2><h3>Families</h3><p>The 3 room layout (2 bedrooms + 1 living room) suits small families who want a home by the sea. Proximity to schools, parks, and the hospital adds reassurance, while the beach just steps away makes family outings effortless.</p><h3>Investors</h3><p>With Oba&rsquo;s popularity among both locals and foreigners, rental demand is strong year-round. Holiday visitors value the beach access, while long-term tenants seek Oba&rsquo;s practicality. Consequently, this apartment offers<strong>high rental potential</strong>in both markets.</p><h3>Retirees and Expats</h3><p>For those seeking a peaceful yet connected life by the sea, Oba provides everything needed &mdash; healthcare, social opportunities, markets, and reliable transport. The apartment&rsquo;s fully furnished condition makes the transition simple.</p><h3>Young Professionals and Digital Nomads</h3><p>Close to caf&eacute;s, restaurants, and the city center, this property also appeals to professionals working remotely. Reliable infrastructure and a vibrant local community combine with the calming proximity of the sea.</p><h2>Investment Perspective &ndash; Why This Apartment Holds Value</h2><p>Properties only 100 meters from the sea are rare in Oba, and this scarcity secures long-term value. When combined with the apartment&rsquo;s<strong>ready-to-move condition</strong>, furnished status, and on-site amenities, it becomes a particularly attractive rental property.</p><p>Buyers also benefit from potential discounts with cash payments, further increasing the financial appeal. With Alanya&rsquo;s property values consistently rising and demand from international buyers growing, this apartment offers security for today and growth for tomorrow.</p><h2>Choosing a Partner You Can Trust</h2><p>Buying property abroad requires more than a good listing &mdash; it demands guidance, clarity, and after-sales support. That is where Luxury Estate Turkey distinguishes itself.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Clear Guidance from Start to Finish</strong>&ndash; From your first inquiry to receiving the keys, every step is explained and managed with transparency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market Expertise</strong>&ndash; Years of experience in Alanya&rsquo;s real estate landscape allow us to match buyers with properties that truly fit their goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and Residency Support</strong>&ndash; We help navigate paperwork, residence permit applications, and legal procedures with confidence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored Service</strong>&ndash; Whether your priority is investment, family living, or a holiday home, we align our recommendations with your vision.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ongoing Support</strong>&ndash; After purchase, we remain available for property management, rental assistance, and resale advice.</p></li></ul><p>For international buyers, we also arrange inspection trips &mdash; giving you the chance to experience Oba and view properties in person before making your decision.</p><p>This 3 room, 100 m&sup2; apartment in Oba combines seafront proximity with practical amenities, offering both lifestyle comfort and investment potential.</p><p><strong>Are you ready to live just 100 meters from the Mediterranean? Contact us today to schedule your private viewing and secure this rare opportunity in Oba.</strong></p></div>",
