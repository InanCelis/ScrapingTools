    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"217\" data-end=\"591\"><strong data-start=\"217\" data-end=\"242\">Gold Aura 2 Residence</strong>is located in Mahmutlar, one of Alanya&rsquo;s most international and lively districts. The area is well known for its friendly atmosphere, wide range of shops, caf&eacute;s, and restaurants, and of course its long sandy beach. Living here means you have everything you need within walking distance, while also being part of a welcoming and diverse community.</p><p data-start=\"593\" data-end=\"910\">The apartment itself is a 65 m&sup2;, 2-room home built in 2018. It is sold fully furnished with appliances, so it&rsquo;s ready for immediate move-in. Being only 500 meters from the sea, it works just as well as a permanent residence as it does a holiday apartment. It also has strong rental potential thanks to its location.</p><h2 data-start=\"3079\" data-end=\"3134\">Interior Design &ndash; Warm Colors and Practical Layout</h2><h3 data-start=\"3136\" data-end=\"3160\">General Atmosphere</h3><p data-start=\"3161\" data-end=\"3534\">The apartment has been designed to make the most of its 65 m&sup2; layout. The open-plan kitchen and living room create a sense of spaciousness, while the choice of<strong data-start=\"3321\" data-end=\"3359\">beige, cream, and light grey tones</strong>enhances natural light and makes the rooms appear larger. Spotlights and hidden LED lighting add a modern edge, while the chandelier introduces a touch of classic elegance.</p><h3 data-start=\"3536\" data-end=\"3565\">Kitchen and Dining Area</h3><p data-start=\"3566\" data-end=\"3892\">The kitchen combines<strong data-start=\"3587\" data-end=\"3612\">glossy white cabinets</strong>with a<strong data-start=\"3620\" data-end=\"3646\">black glass backsplash</strong>, producing a stylish contrast. Built-in appliances make the cooking space fully functional. The dining table is placed smartly between the kitchen and living area, creating a smooth flow. A dark tabletop balances the lighter tones of the room.</p><h3 data-start=\"3894\" data-end=\"3911\">Living Room</h3><p data-start=\"3912\" data-end=\"4194\">Comfort is the main theme here. A cream-beige sofa set creates a cozy and welcoming atmosphere. A large carpet ties the seating area together, making the space feel unified. Instead of a bulky TV wall unit, a simple table is used, which avoids clutter and keeps the room spacious.</p><h3 data-start=\"4196\" data-end=\"4209\">Bedroom</h3><p data-start=\"4210\" data-end=\"4473\">The bedroom follows a minimalist style. A light-colored wardrobe ensures enough storage without overwhelming the space. A delicate pink bedspread and floral curtains add a romantic, soft touch. The lilac accents further enhance the peaceful, restful atmosphere.</p><h3 data-start=\"4475\" data-end=\"4504\">Balcony / Winter Garden</h3><p data-start=\"4505\" data-end=\"4860\">One of the standout features is the balcony, which has been enclosed with glass to create a<strong data-start=\"4597\" data-end=\"4614\">winter garden</strong>.

But only a short 15-minute drive away, Cikcilli offers a quieter, more modern lifestyle. Here you’ll find this apartment for sale in Alanya, a 110 m² home with two bedrooms — one arranged as a master, the other as a child’s room — and a bright living area connected to the kitchen. The enclosed balcony, designed as a versatile extra room, makes this property stand out among other homes in Alanya.</p><h2 data-start=\"944\" data-end=\"1005\">Interior – Minimalist and Functional, with a Family Feel</h2><p data-start=\"1007\" data-end=\"1111\">The apartment’s design is clean and modern, yet softened with details that create a warm, homely feel.</p><ul data-start=\"1113\" data-end=\"2205\"><li data-start=\"1113\" data-end=\"1398\"><p data-start=\"1115\" data-end=\"1398\"><strong data-start=\"1115\" data-end=\"1139\">Living & Dining Area</strong>: Light ceramic flooring makes the space feel wider.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>Fully Furnished 2 Room Apartment for Sale in Oba Exodus Park Residence &ndash; Modern Living, 2km from the Mediterranean</h2><p data-start=\"98\" data-end=\"772\">When choosing a home, the location is far more than just an address&mdash;it sets the tone for your everyday life.<strong data-start=\"207\" data-end=\"214\">Oba</strong>, one of Alanya&rsquo;s most desirable districts, offers the rare mix of a relaxed coastal atmosphere and the convenience of city living. In this sense, the<strong data-start=\"365\" data-end=\"414\">2 room apartment in Oba Exodus Park Residence</strong>fits right in. About<strong data-start=\"436\" data-end=\"477\">2 km from the Mediterranean shoreline</strong>, it places you close enough for spontaneous trips to the beach, yet far enough to enjoy a quieter, more residential setting. Here, modern interiors meet a full range of on-site amenities, creating a home that works equally well for year-round living, a holiday escape, or a rental investment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p data-start=\"774\" data-end=\"1113\">With<strong data-start=\"779\" data-end=\"810\">56 m&sup2; of well-planned space</strong>, the apartment suits singles, couples, or small families who want comfort without unnecessary maintenance. Set in a<strong data-start=\"927\" data-end=\"949\">2021-built complex</strong>, it benefits from up-to-date construction standards, smart layouts, and contemporary finishes&mdash;everything you&rsquo;d expect from a home designed for modern lifestyles.</p><h2>Location Advantages &ndash; Life in the Desirable District of Oba</h2><p>Oba has undergone significant transformation in recent years, attracting both local and international residents. Its reputation comes from its wide, tree-lined streets, sandy beaches, and abundance of amenities. Living here means you can enjoy early morning swims, coffee in boutique cafes, and evening walks along the palm-fringed promenade.</p><p>The<strong>Exodus Park Residence</strong>sits in a convenient yet peaceful pocket of Oba. The beach is just 2km away&mdash;a short drive or a pleasant cycle ride. Within walking distance, you will find supermarkets, fresh produce markets, bakeries, pharmacies, banks, and international schools. For those who rely on public transport, regular bus services connect Oba to Alanya&rsquo;s city center in under 15 minutes.</p><p>For leisure, the area offers both seaside and mountain attractions. The Taurus Mountains provide opportunities for hiking, picnicking, and exploring nature, while Alanya&rsquo;s historic center&mdash;with its castle, harbor, and vibrant nightlife&mdash;remains within easy reach.</p><h2>Interior Design &ndash; Smart, Stylish, and Ready to Move In</h2><p>The apartment&rsquo;s layout integrates functionality with comfort. Entering the home, you step into an open-plan living and kitchen area designed for both relaxation and social interaction. The seating zone features a green-toned corner sofa, which pairs warmly with wood-look kitchen cabinetry. This combination adds a cozy, homely atmosphere, while the black countertop and built-in appliances introduce a sleek, modern contrast.</p><p>Large-format, white marble-patterned ceramic tiles cover the floors, visually expanding the space and reflecting natural light. This choice also makes cleaning and maintenance easy&mdash;a practical detail appreciated in daily life.</p><h3>Lighting and Windows &ndash; Bright and Inviting</h3><p>Generous windows and sliding glass doors allow sunlight to pour into the apartment throughout the day. The chosen window treatments&mdash;sheer curtains and adjustable blinds&mdash;offer flexibility, letting you filter light while maintaining privacy. In the evenings, well-placed ceiling spotlights and wall lamps create a warm ambiance that complements the natural brightness of the daytime.</p><h3>Bedroom &ndash; Calm, Neutral, and Restful</h3><p>The bedroom embraces a palette of neutral colors, promoting rest and relaxation. While it is currently furnished simply, there is room to personalize the space with area rugs, artwork, or decorative lighting. This flexibility allows the new owner to imprint their own style without needing significant renovation.</p><h3>Overall D&eacute;cor &ndash; Cohesive and Comfortable</h3><p>Furniture and finishes are in excellent condition, reflecting the apartment&rsquo;s readiness for immediate occupancy. Thoughtful additions&mdash;like indoor plants, a floor lamp in the living room corner, or floating shelves&mdash;could enhance the lived-in feel and further elevate the interiors.</p><h2>Social and On-Site Amenities &ndash; Resort-Level Comfort at Home</h2><p>Exodus Park Residence offers an impressive range of shared facilities, ensuring residents can enjoy a resort lifestyle without leaving the complex.

Properties within well-managed complexes, close to amenities yet set back from the busiest tourist zones, hold particular value.</p><p>This apartment&rsquo;s features&mdash;modern construction, full furnishings, proximity to the beach, and extensive facilities&mdash;position it as an attractive investment.

Located only 10 km east of Alanya city center, it stretches several kilometers along the Mediterranean coast, framed by sandy beaches on one side and the Taurus Mountains on the other.</p><p data-start=\"1470\" data-end=\"1951\">Walking through Mahmutlar, you immediately notice how international and diverse the community feels. A significant expat population lives here permanently, creating a cosmopolitan yet family-friendly environment. Cafes operated by local families sit next to international chains, and weekly open-air markets fill the streets with color and aroma. On Tuesdays, the famous local bazaar brings residents together with fresh produce, traditional Turkish textiles, and handmade goods.</p><p data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"2385\">Transportation is another strength. Local minibuses connect Mahmutlar internally and run frequently towards Kargıcak. Meanwhile, buses to Alanya center pass every 10 minutes, making the city easily reachable. Taxis are readily available on almost every corner. For shopping, residents enjoy the Yekta Mall and Akdeniz Park shopping centers, while small butchers, bakeries, and hardware shops are scattered throughout the district.</p><p data-start=\"2387\" data-end=\"2833\">Moreover, Mahmutlar is not just about convenience; it is also about lifestyle. The beaches are perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and water sports, while the Taurus Mountains provide hiking and picnic opportunities. Cycling paths run along the coast, and fitness centers, hamams, and yoga studios are easy to find. In short, Mahmutlar has become a district where retirees, young professionals, digital nomads, and families all find their rhythm.</p><h2 data-start=\"2835\" data-end=\"2892\">Apartment Overview &ndash; A Compact and Functional Layout</h2><p data-start=\"2894\" data-end=\"3037\">This<strong data-start=\"2899\" data-end=\"2932\">2 room apartment in Mahmutlar</strong>has a total area of 63 m&sup2;, offering an efficient yet comfortable living space.

It doesn&rsquo;t dictate a style; it simply offers you the freedom to create your own.</p><p>This sense of openness is a huge advantage. Some apartments come with heavy furniture that restricts your vision. Here, the 60 m&sup2; layout offers a blank canvas where you can imagine everything&mdash;from a minimalist Scandinavian palette to a colorful Mediterranean style. The southeast-facing orientation makes natural light flow abundantly, and big windows allow the outdoors to become part of the interior atmosphere. Even without furniture, the apartment already feels airy and inviting.</p><h2>Living Area &ndash; Where Style Meets Practicality</h2><p>The open-plan living room with an American kitchen forms the heart of this apartment. The kitchen is defined by its black countertop against crisp white cabinetry, creating a modern and timeless contrast. Because the space is unfurnished, you can add your personality&mdash;maybe a cozy L-shaped sofa, a round dining table near the balcony doors, or a couple of high stools for a breakfast corner.</p><p>The marble-look flooring gives the room an instant sense of elegance. Even the simplest pieces of furniture will look elevated against this polished background. And thanks to the open-plan design, conversations between the kitchen and living area flow easily&mdash;perfect for hosting friends or simply enjoying evenings with family.</p><h2>Bedrooms &ndash; Calm Corners for Rest and Privacy</h2><p>The apartment offers two bedrooms, each adaptable for different needs. The master bedroom benefits from southeast light, making it a cheerful and warm space in the mornings. Imagine soft curtains in sandy tones, a comfortable bed with pastel linens, and maybe a wall art piece that reflects your taste&mdash;it&rsquo;s easy to picture this room becoming a peaceful retreat.</p><p>The second bedroom is smaller but versatile. It can be used as a guest room, a child&rsquo;s bedroom, or even a home office. Digital nomads who relocate to Mahmutlar often appreciate having a dedicated workspace, and this room could be styled to serve both work and relaxation. Again, the beauty of the apartment being unfurnished is that you have complete freedom to decide.</p><h2>Balcony Life &ndash; Mornings with the Sea, Evenings with the Mountains</h2><p>Step out onto the balcony and the experience changes completely. Here, you&rsquo;re reminded that this is not just an apartment but a Mediterranean home. On one side, the sea shimmers in blue. On the other, the Taurus Mountains create a dramatic green backdrop.</p><p>This balcony is not just a small outdoor corner&mdash;it&rsquo;s a true extension of your living space. In the morning, it&rsquo;s a breakfast spot with fresh air and sea breeze. During the day, it&rsquo;s a quiet reading corner. And in the evening, it becomes the perfect stage for sunsets, drinks with friends, or simply reflecting on the day. Many foreign buyers fall in love with apartments in Mahmutlar specifically because of balconies like this: large enough to furnish, private enough to enjoy, and always with a view worth framing.</p><h2>Resort-Style Living Every Day</h2><p>One of the strongest selling points of<strong>State of Art Residence Mahmutlar</strong>is the complex itself. Living here feels less like owning an apartment and more like holding a membership at a five-star resort.</p><p>Residents enjoy:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Two Swimming Pools</strong>&ndash; a refreshing outdoor pool for sunny days and an indoor heated pool for winter use.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness, Sauna, Hamam, and Steam Room</strong>&ndash; wellness facilities that let you keep both body and mind balanced all year round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Playground</strong>&ndash; safe spaces where little ones can play, while parents relax.</p></li><li><p><strong>Gazebos and Green Areas</strong>&ndash; landscaped gardens and shaded resting spots that give the complex a calm, park-like feeling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parking and Generator</strong>&ndash; practical features that make daily life easy and secure.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-Site Caretaker</strong>&ndash; ensuring the complex remains clean, safe, and well-maintained.</p></li></ul><p>In short, daily life here has a built-in holiday atmosphere. You can finish work, head downstairs for a swim, relax in the sauna, or join neighbors in the garden for a chat. The facilities are designed not just for convenience but to genuinely enrich everyday living.</p><h2>Who Will Love This Apartment?</h2><p><strong>Young Couples and Newlyweds</strong><br />Because it&rsquo;s unfurnished, this apartment allows complete personalization. Couples can design their first home together from scratch, turning a blank space into a warm and stylish nest.</p><p><strong>Investors</strong><br />With its central Mahmutlar location, proximity to the beach, and full facilities, this property has excellent rental potential. Both long-term tenants and short-term holidaymakers look for exactly this type of home: new, modern, and resort-style.</p><p><strong>Holiday Home Seekers</strong><br />If you want the comfort of a five-star hotel but the privacy of your own apartment, this is an ideal match. The facilities replicate the holiday resort feel, while the apartment itself gives you a personal retreat.</p><p><strong>Minimalist City Buyers</strong><br />Some people love clean, light-filled spaces without clutter. This apartment&rsquo;s white tones and bright interior already feel minimalist&mdash;perfect for buyers who prefer simplicity.</p><h3>Mahmutlar &ndash; The International Side of Alanya</h3><p>Mahmutlar is a unique district of Alanya because it blends a calm lifestyle with a strong international community. Many foreigners live here permanently, and as a result, the area offers everything from international restaurants to shops catering to daily needs.</p><p>The seaside promenade stretches for kilometers, lined with cafes where you can sip Turkish tea or enjoy global cuisine. The backdrop of the Taurus Mountains adds a natural beauty that residents never tire of. Weekly markets bring fresh fruits, vegetables, and local products. Small shops, bakeries, and butchers are scattered across the district, while larger malls like Yekta Mall and Akdeniz Park provide modern shopping convenience.</p><p>Transportation is simple: local buses run every 10 minutes to Alanya center, only 10 km away. For shorter trips, taxis are available on every corner. Many residents also cycle, as the flat roads and coastal paths are perfect for biking.</p><p>Mahmutlar has a special appeal for families and retirees who want peace, as well as for younger buyers seeking a lively but not overwhelming lifestyle. You get the best of both worlds&mdash;calm residential atmosphere and easy access to all city amenities.</p><h2>Smart Investment with Lifestyle Value</h2><p>From a financial perspective, this apartment makes sense. Properties in Mahmutlar hold value well, especially those within modern complexes with full facilities. Because this residence is close to the sea, centrally located, and brand new, it sits in one of the most desirable segments of the market.</p><p>High rental demand ensures steady income for investors. At the same time, buyers looking for a permanent home or holiday base benefit from the lifestyle value: sea views, modern design, and access to everything on foot. In other words, it&rsquo;s both a smart investment and a comfortable home.</p><h2>Experience, Honesty, and Ongoing Support</h2><p>Choosing to work with Luxury Estate Turkey means more than just finding a property. Our team offers guidance every step of the way&mdash;from legal checks to residency and citizenship support. We know the Turkish real estate market deeply and provide transparent advice, realistic expectations, and long-term assistance.</p><p>What we promise is simple:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Clear and Honest Communication</strong>&ndash; no surprises, no hidden details.</p></li><li><p><strong>Local Market Knowledge</strong>&ndash; years of experience ensure you make informed choices.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Support</strong>&ndash; from paperwork to furnishing, we help you settle in.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sale Services</strong>&ndash; our relationship doesn&rsquo;t end with the purchase; we stay with you for the long run.</p></li></ul><p>Whether you&rsquo;re buying for investment or a home, our goal is to make the process smooth, secure, and profitable.</p><h3>Contact Us to Unlock This Opportunity</h3><p>If this apartment speaks to your lifestyle or investment goals, now is the moment to act.<strong>Contact us today to arrange a viewing, request more details, or schedule an online consultation.</strong>Properties in Mahmutlar with this combination of sea view, facilities, and location do not stay on the market for long.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>Can a compact home in Alanya still deliver the freedom of a resort lifestyle?</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">In Alanya's Oba neighborhood, life moves at a perfect pace between sandy beaches, vibrant markets, and all the modern conveniences you need. But not everyone is looking for huge spaces or massive villas. Many people - young couples, those who visit seasonally, or smart investors - want something that's both efficient and offers a great lifestyle. That's exactly what you'll find in this fully furnished 2-room, 44 m&sup2;<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>home in Alanya</strong></a>at United Suite Residence.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The building was completed in 2022, so everything feels fresh and modern, with plenty of family-friendly amenities. It sits just 2400 meters from the sea and 1500 meters from Oba's bustling center - close enough to enjoy everything, but far enough to have your peace and quiet. Whether you're buying your first place and want something manageable, looking for good rental returns as an investor, or simply want a cozy summer getaway as a couple, this apartment ticks all the boxes without sacrificing comfort.</p><h2>Designed for Maximum Use of Space</h2><p>The compact size of this apartment is not a limitation but a design challenge solved with intelligence.</p><p><strong>Living Room and Kitchen</strong><br />An open-plan design ensures that the main living space feels larger than its footprint. White cabinetry reflects daylight, while a black countertop anchors the kitchen with contrast. The backsplash follows the same theme, clean and functional. Floors are finished with glossy ceramic tiles, enhancing brightness and creating the illusion of more space.</p><p>The living room area features a brown leather-look sofa that adds warmth to the otherwise neutral palette. Opposite, a minimalist TV unit provides both storage and clean lines, leaving room for personal customization. Together, these choices produce a practical yet inviting atmosphere.</p><p><strong>Bedroom</strong><br />The bedroom makes the most of natural light, thanks to wide glass doors that lead to the balcony. Light parquet floors pair with pastel walls to create a soft, restful tone. A dark headboard provides contrast, while airy curtains allow for either privacy or openness depending on the moment. This is a room designed for both comfort and calm.</p><p><strong>Balcony</strong><br />Balconies in Alanya are essential extensions of living space, and this one delivers. Long and functional, it overlooks the pool area, making it an ideal setting for relaxed evenings or morning coffee. With just a few pieces of outdoor furniture, it can become a second living room during the summer months.</p><p><strong>Atmosphere</strong><br />Minimalism defines the apartment. Instead of crowding the rooms with furniture, the design leaves breathing space. This allows new owners to easily personalize &mdash; whether with art, textiles, or smart furniture solutions. For investors, it means a universally appealing aesthetic that attracts tenants quickly.</p><h2>Facilities That Enrich Daily Living</h2><p>United Suite Residence demonstrates that small apartments can still belong to a complex with big advantages. Residents enjoy:</p><ul><li><p>Outdoor pool with waterslide</p></li><li><p>Sauna and jacuzzi for relaxation</p></li><li><p>Fitness center to maintain an active lifestyle</p></li><li><p>Landscaped green areas and barbecue zones for social gatherings</p></li><li><p>Lobby and caretaker services that add professionalism to the residence</p></li><li><p>Children&rsquo;s pool, play areas, and dedicated kids&rsquo; rooms for family convenience</p></li><li><p>24/7 camera systems ensuring security</p></li></ul><p>These facilities elevate the apartment&rsquo;s function from a simple base to a place where both relaxation and social life can flourish.</p><h2>Oba &ndash; A Neighborhood That Balances Life</h2><p>Owning a home in Oba is about more than the apartment itself. It is about a neighborhood designed for comfort.</p><p>Imagine mornings at the open-air markets on Mondays and Thursdays, where fresh produce and handmade goods fill the streets. Afternoons walking or cycling along palm-lined seafront paths. Evenings spent exploring international restaurants or simply enjoying the quiet of residential streets.</p><p>Oba is also practical:</p><ul><li><p>Major supermarkets and pharmacies are spread across the area.</p></li><li><p>Public transport is reliable, with buses linking to Alanya&rsquo;s center and nearby districts.</p></li><li><p>Alanya Training and Research Hospital provides quality healthcare just minutes away.</p></li><li><p>Schools, sports areas, and shopping venues ensure every need is close.</p></li></ul><p>For families, professionals, or retirees, Oba&rsquo;s combination of leisure and infrastructure makes daily life seamless.</p><h2>Who Will Find This Apartment Ideal?</h2><h3>Young Couples or Singles</h3><p>With manageable size and low maintenance, the apartment suits those beginning their property journey. The fitness, sauna, and pool facilities enrich everyday life without requiring extensive upkeep.</p><h3>Families Seeking a Holiday Base</h3><p>While compact, the apartment works well as a seasonal retreat. Children benefit from pools and play areas, while parents enjoy easy access to the beach and city center.</p><h3>Investors</h3><p>At 44 m&sup2;, the apartment is cost-efficient, with minimal upkeep expenses. Furnished and modern, it appeals strongly to seasonal renters. High rental potential is supported by Oba&rsquo;s popularity among foreign visitors and long-term residents.</p><h3>Digital Nomads and Students</h3><p>For those working remotely or studying, the apartment&rsquo;s layout is functional enough for both living and working. Its location near central amenities ensures that lifestyle and productivity coexist smoothly.</p><h2>A Smart Investment Choice</h2><p>What makes this property stand out for investors is its combination of:</p><ul><li><p>Low purchase and maintenance costs</p></li><li><p>Strong demand for compact, furnished rentals</p></li><li><p>Proximity to<strong>Alanya center and the beach</strong></p></li><li><p>Position in a modern complex with resort-style facilities</p></li></ul><p>Seasonal rentals can yield attractive short-term returns, while long-term leases ensure steady income. With Alanya&rsquo;s market growing and demand from international buyers increasing, such properties are expected to maintain strong liquidity and appreciation.</p><h2>A Partner in Turkey You Can Trust!</h2><p>Luxury Estate Turkey understands that buying property abroad can feel complex. Our mission is to simplify the process, offering guidance tailored to your needs.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Local Insight</strong>&ndash; We know the Alanya market inside and out, ensuring you make informed decisions.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and Residency Support</strong>&ndash; From contracts to residence permits, every detail is handled carefully.</p></li><li><p><strong>Customized Approach</strong>&ndash; We match properties not just to budgets but to lifestyles and goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ongoing Assistance</strong>&ndash; From rental management to resale strategies, our support continues long after purchase.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inspection Trips</strong>&ndash; For international clients, we arrange visits that let you experience properties and neighborhoods firsthand.</p></li></ul><p><strong>When you choose us, you gain more than a property consultant in Turkey &mdash; you gain a partner committed to your financial security and daily comfort.</strong></p><p>This 2 room, 44 m&sup2; apartment in United Suite Residence is proof that compact living can be both stylish and practical.

    "property_description": "<div><h2 class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Spacious 2 Room Apartment for Sale in Vivamus Residence Mahmutlar</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Finding an 80 m&sup2; apartment in Alanya feels like discovering a hidden gem. While most 2-room places here squeeze into 40-45 m&sup2;, this unit at Vivamus Residence Mahmutlar gives you nearly double the space&mdash;and you notice it immediately.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Instead of playing<strong>furniture Tetris</strong>like you would in smaller apartments, you actually get to choose how to arrange your living space. The rooms breathe. There's flow between areas. You're not constantly bumping into things or compromising on comfort.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">What makes this even better? You're just a 7-minute walk from the beach. Usually, you have to pick&mdash;either you get space or you get location. Here, you don't have to choose. Vivamus Residence sits in an established neighborhood with all the amenities you'd want, but you're still close enough to hear the Mediterranean calling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">It's one of those rare finds where the numbers actually translate into a noticeably better living experience.</p><h2 data-start=\"1173\" data-end=\"1231\">Interior Design &ndash; Modern Minimalism with Warm Accents</h2><p data-start=\"1233\" data-end=\"1527\">The apartment embraces<strong data-start=\"1256\" data-end=\"1288\">modern minimalist principles</strong>, focusing on functionality and understated elegance.

The kitchen features glossy white cabinets paired with a striking black mosaic backsplash&mdash;a combination often favored in contemporary urban apartments. The layout maximizes efficiency, keeping everything within easy reach while leaving plenty of space for movement.</p><p data-start=\"1930\" data-end=\"2295\">In the lounge area, a cream-colored corner sofa invites relaxation, while natural wood accents and a metal-framed coffee table introduce an industrial touch. A patterned area rug warms the space and subtly defines the seating zone. The neutral tones of the sofa make it easy to adapt to various d&eacute;cor styles, from Scandinavian minimalism to Mediterranean coastal.</p><h3 data-start=\"2297\" data-end=\"2329\">Bedroom &ndash; Calm and Neutral</h3><p data-start=\"2330\" data-end=\"2660\">The bedroom continues the neutral theme, with a beige upholstered headboard and wood-detailed furniture creating a restful atmosphere. The wardrobe&rsquo;s white-and-wood design strikes a balance between modern style and timeless appeal. This layout and palette particularly suit long-term stays, where comfort and calm are essential.</p><h3 data-start=\"2662\" data-end=\"2697\">Balcony &ndash; Four Seasons of Use</h3><p data-start=\"2698\" data-end=\"3082\">One of the apartment&rsquo;s highlights is its<strong data-start=\"2739\" data-end=\"2766\">large, enclosed balcony</strong>, designed for year-round enjoyment.

For international buyers, this balcony is a versatile space&mdash;ideal as an outdoor dining area, a reading nook, or even a small garden retreat.</p><p data-start=\"3084\" data-end=\"3208\">Overall, the interior offers a perfect foundation for personal customization.

    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"188\" data-end=\"534\">In Mahmutlar, one of Alanya&rsquo;s most vibrant and international neighborhoods, a brand-new chapter of modern living is ready to begin at<strong data-start=\"322\" data-end=\"349\">Haky&uuml;z Life 3 Residence</strong>. Completed in 2024, this development was created with today&rsquo;s lifestyles in mind&mdash;practical for locals, yet equally appealing to the growing expat community that calls Mahmutlar home.</p><p data-start=\"536\" data-end=\"1064\">The apartment itself is a smart 60 m&sup2;, proof that good design doesn&rsquo;t have to be large to feel spacious. Its southeast orientation means your mornings start with soft, natural light, and your evenings settle into the glow of the mountains and the city from your own private balcony. Inside, the American-style kitchen blends seamlessly with the living space, giving the home an open and social character. The fresh, untouched interiors are light and neutral&mdash;a perfect blank canvas for someone who wants to add their own touch.</p><p data-start=\"1066\" data-end=\"1432\">This is a home that adapts to the rhythm of whoever lives here. For a young couple, it&rsquo;s a stylish first step into property ownership. For a digital nomad, it&rsquo;s a bright and comfortable base with easy access to the sea and all of Mahmutlar&rsquo;s amenities. For seasonal residents, it&rsquo;s the kind of lock-up-and-leave property that feels welcoming the moment you return.</p><h3 data-start=\"234\" data-end=\"295\">Interior Atmosphere &ndash; A Blank Canvas for Personal Style</h3><p data-start=\"296\" data-end=\"697\">Step inside and the first thing you notice is the light. Bright, fresh, and clean, it fills the space and bounces off polished porcelain floors with their subtle marble-like texture. The result is an airy, modern feel that&rsquo;s as elegant as it is practical. These glossy surfaces aren&rsquo;t just beautiful&mdash;they&rsquo;re easy to care for, making everyday life, or even short-term rentals, completely hassle-free.</p><h3 data-start=\"699\" data-end=\"712\">Kitchen</h3><p data-start=\"713\" data-end=\"1055\">The American-style kitchen keeps things sleek with its crisp white cabinetry and simple, modern lines. Untouched and waiting, it feels almost symbolic&mdash;the very first meal here will be yours to create. Open to both the living area and balcony, the kitchen invites connection, whether you&rsquo;re entertaining or simply enjoying the quiet of home.</p><h3 data-start=\"1057\" data-end=\"1074\">Living Area</h3><p data-start=\"1075\" data-end=\"1367\">Compact doesn&rsquo;t mean limited&mdash;it means versatile. This living space is ready to shape itself around your lifestyle. A snug sofa and TV unit for cozy evenings, or a dining corner for shared meals&mdash;the layout adapts with ease. Natural light pours in, reinforcing the sense of openness and calm.</p><h3 data-start=\"1369\" data-end=\"1382\">Bedroom</h3><p data-start=\"1383\" data-end=\"1672\">The bedroom is all about comfort and function. Unfurnished, it offers a fresh canvas that can take on many moods: room for a queen-size bed, a wardrobe, and even a desk if you need a personal workspace.

    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"351\" data-end=\"777\">When people search for property in Alanya, Mahmutlar always stands out as a favorite district. Known for its international community, long sandy beaches, and a lifestyle that blends comfort with convenience, it attracts both permanent residents and investors. In this setting,<strong data-start=\"628\" data-end=\"648\">Yıldız Residence</strong>offers a 70 m² apartment with a spacious 2 room layout, just 200 meters from the sea and ready to move in with full furniture.</p><h2 data-start=\"779\" data-end=\"815\">Apartment Features and Interior</h2><p data-start=\"817\" data-end=\"1011\">This apartment is larger than many typical two-room flats in the area, providing a generous and practical living space. Built in 2010, it combines functionality with a fresh and modern design.</p><h3 data-start=\"1013\" data-end=\"1030\">Living Room</h3><p data-start=\"1031\" data-end=\"1437\">The heart of the home features a large corner sofa in dark tones, paired with light-colored walls and glossy ceramic flooring that create a balanced contrast. A TV unit adds functionality, although small adjustments such as cable organization and decorative accessories would make the area even more inviting. The addition of lighter decorative items would balance the strong presence of the darker sofa.</p><h3 data-start=\"1439\" data-end=\"1452\">Kitchen</h3><p data-start=\"1453\" data-end=\"1762\">The open-plan kitchen continues the bright theme with white lacquered cabinets and a glossy backsplash. The layout makes daily use practical, and a dining table with vibrant chairs introduces color. With small additions like wall art or coordinated accessories, this area could achieve a more cohesive look.</p><h3 data-start=\"1764\" data-end=\"1777\">Bedroom</h3><p data-start=\"1778\" data-end=\"2080\">The bedroom offers a calm atmosphere with a classic upholstered bedframe and mirrored wardrobe that expands the visual space. Additional storage boxes, while practical, slightly reduce the sense of openness. Decorative lighting and minimal accessories could transform this room into a cozier retreat.</p><h3 data-start=\"2082\" data-end=\"2096\">Bathroom</h3><p data-start=\"2097\" data-end=\"2356\">The bathroom uses neutral gray ceramics that convey a modern, clean impression.

This location makes it one of the most attractive districts in Alanya for both locals and international residents. Only 10 km away from Alanya city center, Mahmutlar provides a quieter lifestyle while still offering everything you need within walking distance.</p><p>The district has a strong expat community, with a high number of foreign residents who have made Mahmutlar their home. Consequently, you will find a unique cultural mix in everyday life&mdash;family-run Turkish caf&eacute;s stand next to international coffee chains, and traditional bakeries are located near global supermarkets.</p><p>Moreover, Mahmutlar is full of recreational activities. The long beach promenade is excellent for swimming, jogging, cycling, or enjoying sunset walks. Water sports and fishing opportunities abound along the coastline. Behind the town, the Taurus Mountains invite you for hiking, picnics, and fresh mountain air. The area also offers multiple gyms, hamams, and wellness centers for a balanced lifestyle.</p><p>When it comes to shopping, Mahmutlar does not disappoint. Weekly bazaars like the famous Tuesday market (Salı Pazarı) supply fresh produce, spices, and textiles. For bigger needs, shopping centers such as YektaMall and Akdeniz Park are close at hand. In daily life, small butchers, bakeries, and hardware shops can be found across the town.</p><p>Transportation is both simple and frequent. Local minibuses connect Mahmutlar with Kargıcak and Kestel, while buses to Alanya center run every 10 minutes. Taxis are easily available almost everywhere, providing reliable access whenever needed.</p><p>Because of its accessibility, international lifestyle, and safe environment, Mahmutlar has become one of the most attractive choices for families, digital nomads, retirees, and property investors.</p><h2>Edge Residence &ndash; A Modern Complex with Full Facilities</h2><p>Edge Residence stands out with its contemporary architecture, clean lines, and modern materials such as glass balcony railings that give the building a sense of openness and light.

The TV unit has been kept simple, while the built-in electric fireplace effect above the screen adds warmth and coziness, turning the living room into a welcoming gathering point.</p><p>The open-plan kitchen, though compact, is highly functional. Black-and-white cabinets provide a timeless modern look, while the countertop and backsplash ensure both durability and style. Together, the living room and kitchen form a practical, elegant space where daily life flows easily.</p><h3>Bedroom</h3><p>The bedroom design emphasizes warmth and intimacy. Floral-patterned bed linens create a romantic and cozy atmosphere, while wooden details add natural charm. Decorative lamps, bedside tables, and fresh flowers enhance the feeling of a true home.</p><h3>Balcony</h3><p>A balcony is always a valuable feature in Mediterranean apartments, and this unit includes one that expands the living space outdoors. It&rsquo;s ideal for enjoying breakfast in the sun, reading in the afternoon, or sipping tea on warm evenings. With space for a small table and chairs, the balcony extends the usability of the apartment throughout the year.</p><h3>Lighting and Decoration</h3><p>Lighting plays an important role in this home.

    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"632\" data-end=\"1067\">In Mahmutlar, one of Alanya&rsquo;s most popular districts,<strong data-start=\"686\" data-end=\"711\">Bayer Delux Residence</strong>stands out with its modern design, central location, and generous living spaces. Completed in 2020, this residence is home to a<strong data-start=\"840\" data-end=\"918\">65 m&sup2; apartment with 2 rooms (1 bedroom + 1 living room with open kitchen)</strong>. Unlike many smaller apartments in the area, this property offers noticeably more space, making it a practical option for those who value comfort.</p><p data-start=\"1069\" data-end=\"1365\">The apartment is just<strong data-start=\"1091\" data-end=\"1120\">400 meters from the beach</strong>, which means a walk of only a few minutes brings you directly to the Mediterranean shoreline. With modern infrastructure, a wide balcony, and flexible interior design possibilities, this apartment provides both lifestyle and investment value.</p><h2 data-start=\"2951\" data-end=\"3012\">Interior Atmosphere &ndash; A Blank Canvas with Modern Touches</h2><p data-start=\"3014\" data-end=\"3178\">The apartment&rsquo;s interior reflects the advantages of a modern 2020 build. It is empty, which allows the new owner to shape it entirely according to personal taste.</p><h3 data-start=\"3180\" data-end=\"3207\">Flooring and Lighting</h3><p data-start=\"3208\" data-end=\"3553\">The floors are covered with<strong data-start=\"3236\" data-end=\"3268\">large-format porcelain tiles</strong>in a marble-like white finish. This not only enhances the sense of space but also brings a clean, modern look. The ceilings feature<strong data-start=\"3401\" data-end=\"3460\">gypsum details with LED and spot lighting installations</strong>, giving flexibility to create both cozy evenings and bright, functional daylight settings.</p><h3 data-start=\"3555\" data-end=\"3593\">Kitchen &ndash; Functional and Stylish</h3><p data-start=\"3594\" data-end=\"3912\">The<strong data-start=\"3598\" data-end=\"3623\">open American kitchen</strong>uses a combination of<strong data-start=\"3646\" data-end=\"3672\">white lacquer cabinets</strong>and a<strong data-start=\"3679\" data-end=\"3699\">black countertop</strong>, creating a timeless contrast. The<strong data-start=\"3735\" data-end=\"3756\">mosaic backsplash</strong>introduces warmth and texture. The linear placement of cabinets keeps the layout practical, leaving a wide open space for a dining area and living setup.</p><h3 data-start=\"3914\" data-end=\"3956\">Living Room &ndash; Spacious and Adaptable</h3><p data-start=\"3957\" data-end=\"4265\">The rectangular shape of the living room makes furniture placement easy. There is enough space to accommodate a full sofa set and dining table without feeling crowded. Neutral wall colors allow buyers to experiment with different decoration styles, from Scandinavian simplicity to Mediterranean brightness.</p><h3 data-start=\"4267\" data-end=\"4311\">Bedroom &ndash; Comfortable and Light-Filled</h3><p data-start=\"4312\" data-end=\"4645\">The bedroom is wide and nearly square in shape, which ensures a balanced furniture arrangement. A<strong data-start=\"4410\" data-end=\"4433\">French balcony door</strong>brings in natural light, creating an airy atmosphere.

This compact 50 m&sup2; apartment with a 2 room layout offers both investment potential and a stylish new home.</p><p data-start=\"786\" data-end=\"924\">The residence is about a 10-minute walk from the sea and offers beautiful views over both Alanya and the Mediterranean.</p><h2 data-start=\"926\" data-end=\"966\">Apartment in Prime Loft Residence, Alanya</h2><p data-start=\"968\" data-end=\"1187\">The apartment is delivered unfurnished, allowing the buyer to shape the interiors entirely to personal taste. Neutral white walls, glossy marble-look floors, and black-framed windows create a clean, modern foundation.</p><h2 data-start=\"131\" data-end=\"177\">Interior Decoration Ideas for Prime Loft Apartment</h2><p data-start=\"179\" data-end=\"559\">Since the apartment comes unfurnished, we at Luxury Estate Turkey are ready to share brilliant decoration ideas with you:</p><h3 data-start=\"561\" data-end=\"593\">Living Room &amp; Open Kitchen</h3><p data-start=\"594\" data-end=\"1098\">The open-plan living room is long and functional, which allows creative zoning. Near the entrance, a<strong data-start=\"695\" data-end=\"718\">compact dining area</strong>with a wooden or glass-top table works well, while the balcony side can host a<strong data-start=\"798\" data-end=\"822\">comfortable sofa set</strong>. Choosing a light-colored sofa keeps the room bright, while bold throw pillows or a patterned rug add character. If you prefer a minimalist look, keep the palette neutral with whites and grays; if you want warmth, add earthy tones and natural textures like wicker or linen.</p><p data-start=\"1100\" data-end=\"1441\">The<strong data-start=\"1104\" data-end=\"1140\">kitchen cabinets in glossy white</strong>already bring a fresh feel. You can highlight them with matte black handles or metallic fixtures. A row of hanging lights over the counter creates both atmosphere and functionality. Adding small colorful appliances &mdash; like a red coffee machine or a turquoise toaster &mdash; will instantly lift the space.</p><h3 data-start=\"1443\" data-end=\"1456\">Bedroom</h3><p data-start=\"1457\" data-end=\"1861\">The master bedroom benefits from simplicity. A<strong data-start=\"1504\" data-end=\"1547\">queen-sized bed with a wooden headboard</strong>, complemented by soft beige or cream bedding, makes the room cozy without overcrowding it. Installing a<strong data-start=\"1652\" data-end=\"1692\">sliding wardrobe with mirrored doors</strong>saves space and reflects light, making the room appear larger. For a touch of luxury, wall-mounted lamps with warm LED lighting can replace traditional bedside lamps.</p><h3 data-start=\"2458\" data-end=\"2471\">Balcony</h3><p data-start=\"2472\" data-end=\"2918\">The balcony with glass railings offers both city and partial sea views. To make the most of this space, you can place<strong data-start=\"2590\" data-end=\"2621\">rattan chairs with cushions</strong>and a compact coffee table for evening relaxation. Adding<strong data-start=\"2680\" data-end=\"2717\">potted plants or hanging greenery</strong>introduces freshness and blends the indoor-outdoor experience. For those who enjoy entertaining, a slim<strong data-start=\"2822\" data-end=\"2855\">balcony bar table with stools</strong>provides a perfect spot for morning coffee or sunset drinks.</p><h3 data-start=\"2920\" data-end=\"2948\">Lighting &amp; Accessories</h3><p data-start=\"2949\" data-end=\"3022\">Lighting is a key element in making the apartment feel alive. Consider:</p><ul data-start=\"3023\" data-end=\"3221\"><li data-start=\"3023\" data-end=\"3104\"><p data-start=\"3025\" data-end=\"3104\"><strong data-start=\"3025\" data-end=\"3048\">Recessed spotlights</strong>in the living room for an even distribution of light.</p></li><li data-start=\"3105\" data-end=\"3159\"><p data-start=\"3107\" data-end=\"3159\"><strong data-start=\"3107\" data-end=\"3125\">Pendant lights</strong>over the dining area for focus.</p></li><li data-start=\"3160\" data-end=\"3221\"><p data-start=\"3162\" data-end=\"3221\"><strong data-start=\"3162\" data-end=\"3176\">LED strips</strong>under kitchen cabinets for modern accents.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3223\" data-end=\"3431\">As for accessories, large wall art above the sofa, decorative mirrors, and textured rugs bring warmth and personality. Even with minimal furniture, carefully chosen details make the apartment feel complete.</p><h2 data-start=\"304\" data-end=\"336\">This apartment in Alanya is a perfect fit for...</h2><p data-start=\"304\" data-end=\"336\">At Luxury Estate Turkey, we believe every home has its own story &mdash; one that truly begins with the people who live in it.

    "property_title": "New Built Apartment with Pool and Nature View in Demirtas Plaza Alanya",
    "property_description": "<div><p>When people search for property in Alanya, their first thoughts usually go to Mahmutlar, Kestel, or Cleopatra Beach. These areas are indeed popular, but they also come with higher prices and busier streets. Demirtaş, on the other hand, offers something different &mdash; an untouched landscape, quieter beaches, and a slower rhythm of life. With new developments rising, such as<strong>Demirtaş Plaza</strong>, buyers now have the chance to own modern apartments in a district that still feels authentic.</p><p>This particular unit is a<strong>2 room apartment of 60 m&sup2;</strong>, with 1 bathroom and 1 balcony. It will be delivered in<strong>May 2025</strong>, giving buyers the advantage of purchasing early at favorable terms. The apartment is unfurnished, allowing full freedom to design and decorate the interior.</p><h2>Interior and Layout</h2><p>Although compact, the layout has been designed for efficiency and comfort. The living room connects seamlessly with the kitchen, forming the core of the apartment. From here, glass doors open to a balcony that overlooks the<strong>pool and surrounding greenery</strong>, blending indoor and outdoor living.</p><p>The bedroom has enough space for a double bed, wardrobe, and side tables, while still receiving generous daylight. The bathroom features modern fittings, and its simple design will appeal to those who prefer clean lines and functionality.</p><p>Because the apartment is delivered unfurnished, you can decide whether to keep things minimalist or bring in colorful details that reflect your personality. Some buyers may prefer Scandinavian light tones, while others might go for Mediterranean-inspired ceramic touches. Either way, the neutral foundation makes personalization easy.</p><h2>Balcony as a Lifestyle Feature</h2><p>In regions like Demirtaş, balconies are not just architectural add-ons &mdash; they are extensions of daily life. The balcony in this apartment provides enough space for a small table and chairs, making it an ideal spot for morning coffee or evening relaxation. The<strong>pool view and natural surroundings</strong>create a calming backdrop.</p><p>For those who enjoy cooking at home, the balcony also works perfectly as a place to dry herbs, keep potted plants, or even add a small outdoor shelf for seasonal fruits bought from the local markets.</p><h2>Complex Features</h2><p>Demirtaş Plaza offers amenities that support a balanced lifestyle:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Outdoor pool</strong>for warm summer days</p></li><li><p><strong>Children&rsquo;s pool</strong>for families</p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness room</strong>for active residents</p></li><li><p><strong>Sauna</strong>for relaxation after exercise</p></li><li><p><strong>Landscaped garden</strong>for daily walks</p></li><li><p><strong>Elevator</strong>for convenient access</p></li></ul><p>These features make the residence suitable not only for year-round living but also as a holiday home. The pool and garden create a community atmosphere where neighbors can meet, while the fitness and sauna areas provide healthy routines without leaving the building.</p><h2>About Demirtaş: A Different Face of Alanya</h2><p>Unlike Mahmutlar or Oba, Demirtaş has kept its traditional rhythm. It is not dominated by hotels or tourism infrastructure. Instead, wide agricultural fields define the scenery, and many locals continue to farm. This gives the area a genuine village-like character, but with access to the sea and essential services.</p><h3>Everyday Practicality</h3><p>In the center of Demirtaş, just<strong>500 meters from the apartment</strong>, you will find small grocery stores, greengrocers, bakeries, and a few local restaurants. These are usually family-run businesses, where owners greet you by name after a few visits. For larger shopping trips, residents typically drive or take public transport to Mahmutlar or Alanya center.</p><h3>Transport Connections</h3><p>Public buses and minibuses pass regularly on the main road, with<strong>Alanya city center reachable in about 40 minutes</strong>. Taxis are also available for those who prefer private transport. The<strong>Gazipaşa Airport</strong>, only<strong>20 km away</strong>, is a major advantage for international buyers who travel frequently.</p><h3>Beaches and Nature</h3><p>One of the most appealing features of Demirtaş is its coastline. The<strong>beaches are clean and relatively empty</strong>, even in the peak of summer. They are perfect for swimming, sunbathing, or quiet walks along the shore. Unlike central Alanya, you won&rsquo;t find crowded beach clubs here; instead, the focus is on simplicity and nature.</p><p>Beyond the beach, the<strong>Sapadere Canyon</strong>is close by &mdash; a well-known natural attraction with walking paths, waterfalls, and picnic areas. The green mountains surrounding the district also invite hiking and cycling enthusiasts.</p><h3>Dining</h3><p>While the area doesn&rsquo;t have a large restaurant scene, what it offers is authentic. Small, family-run places serve home-style Turkish meals, and along the shore, a few fish restaurants provide freshly caught seafood in a relaxed atmosphere. For many residents, this local approach to dining is part of the charm.</p><h2>Who Should Consider Buying Here?</h2><h3>Families Seeking Peace</h3><p>Families who want their children to grow up in a calm environment will appreciate Demirtaş. The local schools and the safe atmosphere make it appealing for long-term living.</p><h3>Investors Looking Ahead</h3><p>Demirtaş is still at an early stage of development. This means that prices are lower compared to more established neighborhoods. As new projects like Demirtaş Plaza are completed, demand is expected to rise, which will positively affect property values.</p><h3>Digital Nomads and Remote Workers</h3><p>With reliable internet and peaceful surroundings, the area is also suitable for digital professionals who want an affordable yet tranquil base in Turkey. The presence of Gazipaşa Airport nearby ensures easy travel when needed.</p><h2>Investment Perspective</h2><p>Buying property in Demirtaş is not just about the present comfort, but also about future growth. As Alanya expands eastward, more projects will arrive in Demirtaş. Those who purchase now stand to benefit from<strong>capital appreciation</strong>in the coming years.</p><p>Rental income is another angle. While short-term rentals may be more profitable in the center or Mahmutlar, long-term rentals in Demirtaş appeal to families and professionals who value calm. This creates a steady, predictable income stream.</p><h2>Location Advantages at a Glance</h2><ul><li><p><strong>2 km to the beach</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>500 m to Demirtaş center</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>15&ndash;20 minutes to Mahmutlar and Kargıcak</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>20 km to Gazipaşa Airport</strong></p></li><li><p>Close to<strong>Sapadere Canyon</strong>and natural landscapes</p></li></ul><h2>Why Work with Luxury Estate Turkey?</h2><p>Purchasing a home in an emerging area like Demirtaş requires trusted guidance.

It lies between the Mediterranean coast and the Taurus Mountains, about 10 km east of Alanya city center. The district is especially popular with international residents, creating a welcoming<strong>expat community</strong>.</p><h3>Lifestyle and Atmosphere</h3><p>Mahmutlar is ideal for those who want a calm, relaxing environment without losing access to urban conveniences. The long coastline invites swimming, sunbathing, and water sports, while the Taurus Mountain foothills offer opportunities for hiking and picnics in nature. The area is also perfect for cycling, with scenic routes both along the coast and inland.</p><h3>Shopping and Services</h3><p>While most main shops, such as butchers, bakeries, and hardware stores, are located in the center of Mahmutlar, smaller markets and shops are scattered throughout the district. Every Tuesday, the<strong>local market</strong>brings fresh produce, clothing, and household items, making it easy to shop for both essentials and special finds.</p><p>For larger-scale shopping,<strong>YektaMall</strong>and<strong>Akdeniz Park Mall</strong>are both located in Mahmutlar, providing access to brand-name stores and indoor dining.</p><h3>Dining and Caf&eacute;s</h3><p>Mahmutlar is home to numerous family-run caf&eacute;s, giving the area a friendly, local atmosphere. Alongside these, you&rsquo;ll also find well-known Turkish and international restaurant and caf&eacute; chains, ensuring plenty of variety.</p><h3>Transport Connections</h3><p>Getting around Mahmutlar is simple. Local minibuses operate frequently within the district, including routes toward Kargıcak and Alanya. Buses to Alanya city center run approximately every 10 minutes in both directions. Taxis are also available almost everywhere, offering convenience for short trips or airport transfers.</p><h3>Proximity to Neighboring Districts</h3><p>Mahmutlar is close to<strong>Kargıcak</strong>and<strong>Kestel</strong>, providing even more leisure and shopping opportunities. While it is more active and lively than its neighbors, Mahmutlar still maintains a relaxed seaside charm.</p><h2>Investment Potential &ndash; High Demand in a Popular Area</h2><p>With its growing popularity among both local and international buyers, Mahmutlar offers strong investment potential. Apartments within walking distance of the beach, in well-maintained complexes with full social facilities, are always in high demand.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rental Yield</strong>&ndash; Seasonal holiday rentals and long-term leases both bring solid returns.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resale Value</strong>&ndash; Limited availability of modern apartments near the beach ensures stable property appreciation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Lifestyle Appeal</strong>&ndash; The combination of coastal living, modern facilities, and an international community attracts buyers year-round.</p></li></ul><h2>A Typical Day in Mahmutlar</h2><p>Imagine starting your morning with a walk along the promenade, followed by breakfast at one of the seaside caf&eacute;s. Later, you might shop at the local Tuesday market, picking up fresh fruit and vegetables. The afternoon could be spent swimming in the complex&rsquo;s pool or enjoying a Turkish bath session, while evenings might involve a barbecue with friends or a relaxed dinner in the center of Mahmutlar.</p><p>This is everyday life here&mdash;balanced, convenient, and surrounded by the natural beauty of the Mediterranean.</p><h2>Why Work with Luxury Estate Turkey?</h2><p>Purchasing property abroad should be an exciting, not stressful, experience.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>What if your first<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">home in Alanya</a>could feel like a brand-new canvas for the life you imagine?</h2><p>Many buyers dream of moving to Alanya&rsquo;s Oba area &mdash; drawn by its endless beaches, lively markets, and the comfort of knowing everything is just a walk away. But finding a newly built apartment that allows you to start fresh, decorate to your taste, and enjoy the advantages of a full social complex is not always simple.</p><p>Green Garden Residence delivers exactly that. Completed in June 2025, this boutique project offers modern design, quality construction, and amenities designed for both relaxation and practicality.</p><p>Only 1,800 meters from the sea (around a 20-minute walk, or just a few minutes by car), offering the perfect balance between coastal living and everyday convenience. And with a clean title deed ready for transfer, this 2 room, 50 m&sup2; corner apartment is more than a property &mdash; it&rsquo;s the beginning of a lifestyle.</p><h2>Interiors That Wait for Your Touch</h2><p>Because the apartment is delivered unfurnished, it becomes a blank page for its new owner. Yet the choices made by the developer already establish a strong foundation:</p><p><strong>Floors That Elevate Space</strong><br />Large, glossy tiles with a marble-like finish stretch across the living areas, reflecting natural light and enhancing the sense of space. They offer both elegance and easy maintenance &mdash; ideal for modern living.</p><p><strong>Walls That Keep Possibilities Open</strong><br />Painted in neutral cream and white, the walls serve as a subtle backdrop. They allow for maximum flexibility, whether you prefer the clean lines of Scandinavian minimalism, the warmth of Mediterranean textures, or the bold character of industrial chic.</p><p><strong>Windows That Frame Light and Views</strong><br />Black-framed, floor-to-ceiling windows define the atmosphere of the apartment. They add modern contrast while ensuring natural light pours in. With a view of the pool and surrounding cityscape, the living space feels open, airy, and connected.</p><p><strong>A Kitchen with Modern Precision</strong><br />The open-plan kitchen is compact but efficient. White cabinetry keeps the space bright, while a black stone-effect backsplash adds a dramatic counterpoint. This contrast provides both elegance and modern energy.</p><p><strong>Ceiling and Lighting Details</strong><br />Recessed spotlights give the apartment a clean, contemporary rhythm. The lighting plan ensures functionality, but it also highlights the neutral palette, making the space feel brighter and more inviting.</p><p>Taken together, these features turn the apartment into a ready canvas. With the right furniture, it can adapt to very different lifestyles: minimalist calm, vibrant youthfulness, or refined sophistication.</p><h2>Daily Life Made Practical</h2><p>The layout may be compact, but it has been designed to maximize comfort. The living area connects smoothly with the kitchen, creating a sociable hub where cooking and conversation blend naturally. The balcony extends this space outdoors, offering views of the pool below &mdash; perfect for a morning coffee or evening pause.</p><p>This is a home built for functional ease. Its proportions make it easy to maintain, while still offering enough room to feel spacious. For single professionals, couples, or small families, it answers the question of how to live in Oba with both convenience and style.</p><h2>Lifestyle Options for Every Taste</h2><p>The neutral backdrop invites creativity. Depending on the choices of its owner, the apartment could transform into:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Scandinavian Retreat</strong>&ndash; White furniture, natural wood accents, and light textiles emphasize airiness and calm.</p></li><li><p><strong>Industrial Modern</strong>&ndash; Black metal shelving, statement lighting, and leather chairs create an edgy urban atmosphere.</p></li><li><p><strong>Youthful Mediterranean</strong>&ndash; Pastel fabrics, woven details, and green plants add vibrancy and local warmth.</p></li></ul><p>Each approach harmonizes with the existing finishes, proving that this home is flexible enough to support any vision.</p><h2>Facilities That Turn a Complex into a Community</h2><p>Green Garden Residence was designed not only for living, but for living well. The amenities ensure residents can relax, stay active, and enjoy community life without leaving home:</p><ul><li><p>Swimming pool with sun terrace</p></li><li><p>Fitness center</p></li><li><p>Sauna and Turkish bath</p></li><li><p>Children&rsquo;s playroom and pool</p></li><li><p>Landscaped green areas and pavilion</p></li><li><p>Barbecue space for social gatherings</p></li><li><p>Secure entrance with door guards and 24/7 cameras</p></li><li><p>Bicycle parking and open car park</p></li></ul><p>These features create a residential setting that feels more like a small resort &mdash; but with the privacy and comfort of a home.</p><h2>Oba &ndash; Where Daily Needs Meet Seaside Leisure</h2><p>The location adds further strength. Oba is one of Alanya&rsquo;s most balanced neighborhoods, where modern living blends with a relaxed seaside lifestyle.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Beaches and Sports</strong>&ndash; Residents enjoy kilometers of sandy coastline for swimming, sunbathing, and water sports, plus tennis and football fields nearby.</p></li><li><p><strong>Markets Twice Weekly</strong>&ndash; Mondays and Thursdays bring vibrant street markets, filled with fresh produce, clothes, and household goods.</p></li><li><p><strong>Healthcare Access</strong>&ndash; Alanya Training and Research Hospital is located in Oba, giving families and retirees extra reassurance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Transport</strong>&ndash; Almost every bus route passes through Oba, meaning the city center and nearby areas like Tosmur, Kestel, and Mahmutlar are easily reached.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shops and Dining</strong>&ndash; From Migros to small local shops, and from international restaurants to local caf&eacute;s, everyday needs are always close.</p></li></ul><p>Living here means not having to choose between leisure and practicality &mdash; both are naturally integrated into daily life.</p><h2>Who Will Feel at Home in Green Garden Residence?</h2><h3>Young Couples and Families</h3><p>Compact but efficient, the apartment makes daily living easy while offering the benefits of a full complex. Families will appreciate the children&rsquo;s facilities, while couples will enjoy the privacy of a corner unit.</p><h3>Investors</h3><p>Newly completed in 2025, the apartment holds high rental potential. Its location, social amenities, and fresh construction appeal to both long-term tenants and short-term holiday renters, ensuring steady income streams.</p><h3>Digital Nomads</h3><p>The quiet setting, strong natural light, and balcony views make this apartment a strong option for remote professionals. A home office can easily fit into the living area, while leisure is just outside the door.</p><h3>International Buyers</h3><p>For those considering a first property in Turkey, Green Garden Residence represents a manageable size, attractive price point, and the reassurance of a newly built, fully serviced complex.</p><h2>Investment Potential &ndash; Why This Apartment Works</h2><p>Alanya&rsquo;s property market has grown steadily, with Oba playing a central role. The scarcity of newly built apartments close to the sea makes properties like this highly attractive for both resale and rental.</p><p>Moreover, because the project was only completed in June 2025, owners benefit from the assurance of brand-new construction, modern regulations, and efficient building systems. Combined with the location and facilities, it is a package designed to hold value and generate returns.</p><h2>Choosing the Right Partner in Your Search</h2><p>At Luxury Estate Turkey, we understand that purchasing property abroad is about more than numbers. It is about security, lifestyle, and long-term satisfaction.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Transparency and Trust</strong>&ndash; We explain every step clearly, from contracts to title deed transfer.</p></li><li><p><strong>Local Expertise</strong>&ndash; With years of experience in the Alanya market, we help you avoid common pitfalls.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored Guidance</strong>&ndash; Whether you seek a home, an investment, or both, we focus on your priorities.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sales Support</strong>&ndash; Assistance with furnishing, rental management, and daily logistics continues after the purchase.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inspection Trips</strong>&ndash; For clients abroad, we arrange visits that allow you to see properties firsthand, explore the area, and decide with confidence.</p></li></ul><p>By working with us, you gain more than access to listings. You gain a reliable partner dedicated to protecting your investment and helping you build the life you envision in Turkey.</p><p>This 2 room, 50 m&sup2; apartment at Green Garden Residence combines fresh construction, practical design, and a full set of amenities in one of Alanya&rsquo;s most desirable neighborhoods.</p><p><strong>Could this be the starting point for your new chapter in Oba? Contact us today to schedule your private viewing.</strong></p></div>",

    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"862\" data-end=\"1316\">If you are looking for a compact and modern<strong data-start=\"906\" data-end=\"938\">apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>, this 2 room home in Kurt Suit Complex in Kargıcak presents an excellent opportunity. With a total of 55 m&sup2;, it delivers a functional layout, stylish infrastructure, and strong investment potential. The apartment sits only 500 meters from the beach, 14 km from Alanya center, and 28 km from Gazipaşa Airport&mdash;ensuring easy access to both daily living and international travel.</p><p data-start=\"1318\" data-end=\"1747\">The property is especially appealing because of its modern foundation: glossy marble-effect floors, grey-beige wall tones, matte kitchen cabinetry, and black-framed windows. These details provide a clean canvas for multiple design possibilities, making it easy to adapt the apartment to different lifestyles. Whether you are planning to live here yourself, rent it out, or keep it as a holiday escape, this home fits perfectly.</p><h2 data-start=\"1749\" data-end=\"1796\">Interior Design and Decoration Suggestions</h2><p data-start=\"1797\" data-end=\"1966\">This apartment has been kept neutral, which allows future owners to personalize it in a variety of styles. Below are suggestions that enhance comfort and create value.</p><h3 data-start=\"1968\" data-end=\"2002\">Living Room &ndash; Modern Comfort</h3><p data-start=\"2003\" data-end=\"2324\">The living room can be furnished with a light-toned L-shaped sofa, either beige or grey, to match the flooring. A set of colorful cushions will introduce warmth and personality. A medium-sized plain rug complements the open space, while a modern TV unit in white or light wood with black accents creates visual balance.</p><h3 data-start=\"2326\" data-end=\"2364\">Kitchen &ndash; Functional and Elegant</h3><p data-start=\"2365\" data-end=\"2626\">The kitchen already includes a matte cabinetry style.

A compact dining table for four fits easily, preferably in a wood or monochrome design to echo the black-and-white theme.</p><h3 data-start=\"2628\" data-end=\"2662\">Bedroom &ndash; Cozy and Practical</h3><p data-start=\"2663\" data-end=\"2931\">A light-colored headboard in fabric or leather, matched with pastel-toned bedding, enhances the feeling of calm. Sliding wardrobes save space and maintain a clean look. Curtains should combine sheer voile with blackout layers, allowing flexibility for day and night.</p><h3 data-start=\"2933\" data-end=\"2966\">Balcony &ndash; Outdoor Enjoyment</h3><p data-start=\"2967\" data-end=\"3130\">A small rattan or metal furniture set turns the balcony into a breakfast spot or evening retreat. Adding potted plants introduces a natural, Mediterranean touch.</p><h3 data-start=\"3132\" data-end=\"3151\">Style Options</h3><ul data-start=\"3152\" data-end=\"3434\"><li data-start=\"3152\" data-end=\"3232\"><p data-start=\"3154\" data-end=\"3232\"><strong data-start=\"3154\" data-end=\"3175\">Modern Minimalist</strong>&ndash; Simple furniture, neutral colors, functional layout.</p></li><li data-start=\"3233\" data-end=\"3335\"><p data-start=\"3235\" data-end=\"3335\"><strong data-start=\"3235\" data-end=\"3259\">Mediterranean Breeze</strong>&ndash; Beige and white as a base, combined with blue or turquoise accessories.</p></li><li data-start=\"3336\" data-end=\"3434\"><p data-start=\"3338\" data-end=\"3434\"><strong data-start=\"3338\" data-end=\"3361\">Investment-Friendly</strong>&ndash; Neutral furniture, easy-to-clean materials, and durable accessories.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3436\" data-end=\"3534\">These suggestions show how easily the apartment can be adapted to suit different buyer profiles.</p><h2 data-start=\"3536\" data-end=\"3572\">Facilities in Kurt Suit Complex</h2><p data-start=\"3573\" data-end=\"3658\">The complex offers a range of features designed to provide convenience and leisure.</p><ul data-start=\"3660\" data-end=\"3938\"><li data-start=\"3660\" data-end=\"3685\"><p data-start=\"3662\" data-end=\"3685\">Outdoor swimming pool</p></li><li data-start=\"3686\" data-end=\"3710\"><p data-start=\"3688\" data-end=\"3710\">Children&rsquo;s play park</p></li><li data-start=\"3711\" data-end=\"3729\"><p data-start=\"3713\" data-end=\"3729\">Fitness center</p></li><li data-start=\"3730\" data-end=\"3754\"><p data-start=\"3732\" data-end=\"3754\">Sauna for relaxation</p></li><li data-start=\"3755\" data-end=\"3793\"><p data-start=\"3757\" data-end=\"3793\">Pavilion and landscaped green area</p></li><li data-start=\"3794\" data-end=\"3818\"><p data-start=\"3796\" data-end=\"3818\">Secure open car park</p></li><li data-start=\"3819\" data-end=\"3856\"><p data-start=\"3821\" data-end=\"3856\">24/7 camera system with caretaker</p></li><li data-start=\"3857\" data-end=\"3898\"><p data-start=\"3859\" data-end=\"3898\">Cable TV and satellite infrastructure</p></li><li data-start=\"3899\" data-end=\"3938\"><p data-start=\"3901\" data-end=\"3938\">Barbecue area for social gatherings</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"3940\" data-end=\"4072\">These facilities ensure that even though the apartment is compact, residents enjoy a lifestyle filled with comfort and recreation.</p><h2 data-start=\"4074\" data-end=\"4108\">Who Will Love This Apartment?</h2><h3 data-start=\"4110\" data-end=\"4147\">Young Couples and Professionals</h3><p data-start=\"4148\" data-end=\"4339\">The compact layout is easy to maintain, while the modern infrastructure allows for personalization.

Its location just 500 meters from the Mediterranean makes it an excellent seasonal residence.</p><h2 data-start=\"4771\" data-end=\"4833\">Living in Kargıcak &ndash; Coastal Charm and Modern Convenience</h2><p data-start=\"4834\" data-end=\"5026\">Kargıcak, located east of Alanya, has become one of the most desirable districts for both locals and foreign buyers. It combines beautiful nature, clean beaches, and practical accessibility.</p><h3 data-start=\"5028\" data-end=\"5052\">Beaches and Nature</h3><p data-start=\"5053\" data-end=\"5369\">Kargıcak&rsquo;s beaches are known for their clarity and cleanliness. Some parts are rich in marine life, ideal for diving and snorkeling. Beyond the coastline, pine forests and agricultural land create a green backdrop, while the Taurus Mountains invite outdoor activities such as hiking, cycling, and horseback riding.</p><h3 data-start=\"5371\" data-end=\"5389\">Daily Living</h3><p data-start=\"5390\" data-end=\"5669\">Although Kargıcak has small shops and markets for everyday needs, many residents prefer larger shopping trips to Mahmutlar or Alanya center. Within Kargıcak itself, family-owned caf&eacute;s and restaurants serve traditional Turkish dishes, while seaside fish restaurants add variety.</p><h3 data-start=\"5671\" data-end=\"5704\">Transport and Accessibility</h3><p data-start=\"5705\" data-end=\"5996\">Public transport is reliable, with buses 1, 2, and 3 going directly into Kargıcak center.

    "property_description": "<div><h2 data-start=\"395\" data-end=\"707\">Why Buyers Are Looking to Properties in Mersin Right Now?</h2><p data-start=\"395\" data-end=\"707\">Have you ever wondered what it feels like to own a<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/cheap-property-in-alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">cheap property in Turkey</a>that still gives you the kind of sea view usually reserved for luxury homes? In Arpa&ccedil;bahşiş, a quiet part of Erdemli, Mersin, a brand-new residence completed in August 2024 is making that dream more realistic than you might think.</p><p data-start=\"709\" data-end=\"1152\">Life here feels different from the busy coastal hotspots. From the balcony, your morning coffee comes with a full view of the Mediterranean. The open-plan living room and kitchen flow toward that same horizon, reminding you why people look for a sea view<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/mersin\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">property in Mersin</a>in the first place. And the best part? Property prices compared to Alanya are still much lower, which means you step into a growing market at the right moment.</p><p data-start=\"625\" data-end=\"912\">When people talk about buying a property in Mersin, the conversation often starts with price. Compared to Alanya, Mersin still offers that rare opportunity: modern complexes with sea views at costs that feel like Alanya ten years ago. For investors, this means one thing&mdash;potential.</p><p data-start=\"914\" data-end=\"1301\">Arpa&ccedil;bahşiş, a growing area of Erdemli- Mersin, has become one of the key spots where locals and international buyers quietly move in. It is calm enough to feel residential, but close enough to Erdemli center for daily needs. And unlike overly crowded resort towns, here you can actually find neighbors who know your name, bakeries run by families, and local markets that still feel authentic.</p><p data-start=\"1303\" data-end=\"1459\">For anyone searching for a cheap property in Turke<strong data-start=\"1330\" data-end=\"1358\">y</strong>without compromising on comfort, this new residence, completed in August 2024, is worth attention.</p><h2 data-start=\"1461\" data-end=\"1508\">A Brand-New Home: Completed in August 2024</h2><p data-start=\"1510\" data-end=\"1815\">The apartment is not a renovation, not a second-hand deal&mdash;it&rsquo;s a freshly delivered home. Construction finished in August 2024, which means you become the very first owner. Everything inside is untouched, the materials are new, and the design reflects today&rsquo;s expectations for space, light, and function.</p><p data-start=\"1817\" data-end=\"2009\">That newness carries peace of mind. You won&rsquo;t be thinking about repairs, you won&rsquo;t need to replace old furniture right away, and you can simply plan your interior style around a clean slate.</p><h2 data-start=\"2011\" data-end=\"2059\">Interior Design with a Modern Classic Touch</h2><h3 data-start=\"2061\" data-end=\"2087\">Entrance and Hallway</h3><p data-start=\"2088\" data-end=\"2359\">The moment you step in, porcelain-look floors give a polished and modern feel. Yet, the cabinet doors with classical embossed details soften the mood, adding a touch of timeless style. It&rsquo;s a subtle mix that sets the tone: modern functionality with a hint of character.</p><h3 data-start=\"2361\" data-end=\"2373\">Floors</h3><p data-start=\"2374\" data-end=\"2630\">In the living spaces, grey-toned parquet creates a minimalist base. Neutral colors make the apartment easy to furnish, no matter your personal taste. From Scandinavian white furniture to warmer Mediterranean tones, everything fits this flexible backdrop.</p><h3 data-start=\"2632\" data-end=\"2645\">Kitchen</h3><p data-start=\"2646\" data-end=\"2941\">The kitchen stands out with glass-front cabinets, light-colored doors, and a bold black backsplash. This is where &ldquo;modern classic&rdquo; comes alive: clean lines meet decorative accents. Practical and aesthetic at the same time, it&rsquo;s ready for both daily family use and weekend dinners with friends.</p><h3 data-start=\"2943\" data-end=\"2974\">Living Room with Sea View</h3><p data-start=\"2975\" data-end=\"3329\">Perhaps the biggest highlight: the living area flows directly to the balcony, framing the Mediterranean like a living painting. Whether you sit on the sofa or at the dining table, your eye is pulled to the horizon. This is the emotional value of owning a sea view property in Mersin&mdash;it becomes part of your daily routine, not just a holiday luxury.</p><h3 data-start=\"3331\" data-end=\"3345\">Bedrooms</h3><p data-start=\"3346\" data-end=\"3601\">The two bedrooms are designed with simplicity and light in mind. Large windows bring in both sunlight and a glimpse of the sea. Neutral walls combined with the grey parquet create a calming space, perfect for restful nights or a quiet home office setup.</p><h3 data-start=\"3603\" data-end=\"3618\">Balconies</h3><p data-start=\"3619\" data-end=\"3881\">Spacious balconies extend the apartment&rsquo;s footprint. They&rsquo;re not just functional; they invite use. One could easily transform into a breakfast nook, another into a small garden with potted plants. And of course, the sea view makes every balcony moment special.</p><h3 data-start=\"3883\" data-end=\"3897\">Bathroom</h3><p data-start=\"3898\" data-end=\"4093\">White ceramic tiles keep the bathroom bright and fresh, while modern fixtures emphasize ease of use.
