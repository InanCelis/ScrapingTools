    "property_description": "<div><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">When people talk about<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/luxury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">luxury real estate in Alanya</a>, they usually mention square meters and amenities. But how do you put a price on the moment your shoulders drop and your breathing slows just because you stepped onto your terrace? That's the kind of luxury that doesn't show up in property listings &ndash; the luxury of coming home to peace- a kind of luxury that also qualifies you for<strong>Turkish citizenship.</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Picture this: You wake up, pad barefoot to your kitchen, and while your coffee brews, you're looking out at the ancient Alanya Castle sitting proudly on its cliff, the endless blue sea stretching to the horizon, mountains rising like sleeping giants in the distance. This isn't a vacation moment you'll treasure forever &ndash; this is just Tuesday morning at your new sea view property in Alanya.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">But let's flip the script for a moment. Forget the morning coffee &ndash; let's talk about coming home after a long day. You pull into your private parking, take the elevator up to your sea view home in Alanya, and suddenly the stress of the day just melts away. Why?<strong>Because you're watching one of the most spectacular light shows on earth unfold right in front of you.</strong></p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">As the sun sets, Alanya Castle transforms from ancient stone to a glowing beacon, its lights reflecting off the water like scattered diamonds. You can see the little houses clustered around the castle hill starting to twinkle to life &ndash; windows lighting up one by one as families settle in for the evening, the warm glow of homes creating a constellation against the darkening hillside. And above it all, the moon begins its slow climb across the sky, casting silver paths across the water that seem to lead straight to your balcony.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\"><strong>This isn't just a view you admire &ndash; it's therapy you live with every single evening.</strong></p><p>Standing proud on 600m&sup2; of carefully planned land, this 525m&sup2; architectural masterpiece rises through four thoughtfully designed floors. But calling it a house feels almost insulting to what it truly represents. This is your private resort, your wellness sanctuary, your entertainment hub, and your peaceful retreat all wrapped into one extraordinary address.</p><p>The moment you step inside, the distinction between indoor and outdoor living dissolves completely. Floor-to-ceiling glass walls don't just frame views &ndash; they invite the Mediterranean landscape to become part of your daily life. Dark and light grey stone cladding gives the exterior a sophisticated strength that commands respect, while the interior's palette of whites, creams, and soft greys creates an atmosphere that breathes tranquility into every corner.</p><h2>Villa Infinity brings you sea view in Alanya along with the benefit of Turkish citizenship eligibility</h2><p data-start=\"458\" data-end=\"749\">Here&rsquo;s where Villa Infinity transforms from a beautiful home into a life-changing investment. This property is fully eligible for the<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/blog/types-of-passports-in-turkey-and-the-advantages-of-turkish-citizenship-in-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkish Citizenship by Investment program</a>, giving you and your family the right to secure a new future in Turkey with all the privileges that come with it.</p><p data-start=\"751\" data-end=\"1216\">And Turkish citizenship means more than just holding a new passport. It offers security in a stable country, access to quality healthcare and education, and the chance to establish your life in a vibrant Mediterranean city. For investors, it creates a foundation for long-term returns, while for families it guarantees a safe and welcoming environment to call home. Villa Infinity is therefore not only a residence, but a direct path to a stronger and more certain future.</p><h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\">Architectural Character &amp; Exterior</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This striking villa makes a bold first impression with its sophisticated blend of dark and light grey stone cladding that creates a powerful, contemporary presence. The extensive use of floor-to-ceiling glass panels and sleek glass railings doesn't just bring a modern edge &ndash; it frames the surrounding landscape like a living artwork, making the views an integral part of the home's design story.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The architectural language speaks of understated luxury, where every material choice has been carefully considered to create a sense of permanence and elegance that will age gracefully over time.</p><h2>Interior Palette &amp; Atmosphere</h2><p>Step inside, and you're immediately embraced by a carefully curated color story that feels both fresh and timeless. The interior palette revolves around crisp whites, warm creams, soft beiges, and sophisticated greys &ndash; a combination that breathes serenity into every corner while maintaining an air of refined elegance. This isn't just decoration; it's the foundation of a lifestyle that values calm sophistication over fleeting trends.</p><p>The overall effect is one of spacious tranquility, where natural light dances across neutral surfaces, creating an ever-changing canvas of subtle shadows and highlights throughout the day.</p><h2>Living &amp; Social Spaces</h2><p>The heart of the home showcases stunning white marble-effect flooring with clean, linear patterns that immediately evoke the luxury of a five-star hotel. But this isn't cold or intimidating &ndash; quite the opposite. The flooring serves as a beautiful backdrop for carefully selected furniture pieces that prioritize both comfort and contemporary style.</p><p>The seating areas feature plush, rounded-edge sofas and chairs with soft textures that invite you to sink in and stay awhile. These aren't just beautiful pieces &ndash; they're designed for real living, real conversations, real moments with family and friends.</p><p>Above, dramatic spherical pendant lights and strategically placed LED recessed lighting create layers of illumination that can shift the mood from bright and energizing during the day to intimate and cozy in the evening. The lighting design doesn't just illuminate spaces; it sculpts them, adding depth and drama to every gathering.</p><h2>Dining &amp; Kitchen Experience</h2><p>The dining area centers around an elegant oval white table surrounded by minimalist chairs that capture the essence of Scandinavian modern design &ndash; clean, functional, and effortlessly stylish. This isn't formal dining that intimidates; it's a space that welcomes both intimate family meals and larger gatherings with equal grace.</p><p>The kitchen island and accompanying bar stools transform cooking from a chore into a social experience. Whether you're preparing a quiet breakfast or hosting a dinner party, the design encourages interaction and connection. The thoughtful integration of warm wood cladding against the predominantly white surfaces adds just the right amount of natural warmth, preventing the space from feeling stark or cold.</p><p>This is a kitchen designed for real life &ndash; beautiful enough for entertaining, practical enough for everyday living.</p><h2>Private Retreats</h2><p>The bedrooms continue the hotel-inspired luxury theme, with carefully selected headboards and linens that create an immediate sense of refined comfort. These aren't just places to sleep &ndash; they're personal sanctuaries designed for true rest and rejuvenation.</p><p>The master suite takes luxury to the next level with a bathtub elegantly integrated into the bedroom space itself. This bold design choice creates an immediate spa-like atmosphere, blurring the lines between sleeping, bathing, and relaxation into one seamless experience of personal indulgence.</p><h2>Wellness &amp; Mindfulness</h2><p>Perhaps most uniquely, the villa features a dedicated wellness room that serves as a yoga and meditation sanctuary. Large mirrors amplify the natural light and sense of space, while a golden-toned Buddha statue provides a focal point for contemplation. The abundance of natural light streaming through oversized windows creates an authentic \"zen\" atmosphere that supports both physical practice and mental clarity.</p><p><em>This villa in Alanya represents more than just luxury living &ndash; it's a thoughtfully designed environment that supports both social connection and personal well-being, where every detail has been considered to create a home that's as beautiful as it is livable.</em></p><h2 data-start=\"5572\" data-end=\"5608\">Outdoor Living with a Hawaiian Spirit</h2><p data-start=\"5610\" data-end=\"5664\">Step outside, and the property continues to impress.</p><ul data-start=\"5666\" data-end=\"6375\"><li data-start=\"5666\" data-end=\"5830\"><p data-start=\"5668\" data-end=\"5830\"><strong data-start=\"5668\" data-end=\"5685\">Infinity Pool</strong>&ndash; Positioned to capture the full panorama of the Mediterranean and Alanya Castle, with glass barriers ensuring the view remains uninterrupted.</p></li><li data-start=\"5831\" data-end=\"5988\"><p data-start=\"5833\" data-end=\"5988\"><strong data-start=\"5833\" data-end=\"5850\">Garden Design</strong>&ndash; Inspired by tropical aesthetics, it combines palm trees, bright flowers, and lush greenery to create a feeling reminiscent of Hawaii.</p></li><li data-start=\"6251\" data-end=\"6375\"><p data-start=\"6253\" data-end=\"6375\"><strong data-start=\"6253\" data-end=\"6279\">Outdoor Shower for Two</strong>&ndash; A detail that blends practicality with indulgence, adding to the villa&rsquo;s spa-like identity.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"6377\" data-end=\"6518\">Every inch of outdoor space is crafted to extend living beyond the villa&rsquo;s walls, ensuring both relaxation and activity are always at hand.</p><h2 data-start=\"5572\" data-end=\"5608\">Outdoors with a Hawaiian Spirit</h2><p data-start=\"5610\" data-end=\"5664\">Step outside, and the property continues to impress.</p><ul data-start=\"5666\" data-end=\"6375\"><li data-start=\"5666\" data-end=\"5830\"><p data-start=\"5668\" data-end=\"5830\"><strong data-start=\"5668\" data-end=\"5685\">Infinity Pool</strong>&ndash; Positioned to capture the full panorama of the Mediterranean and Alanya Castle, with glass barriers ensuring the view remains uninterrupted.</p></li><li data-start=\"5831\" data-end=\"5988\"><p data-start=\"5833\" data-end=\"5988\"><strong data-start=\"5833\" data-end=\"5850\">Garden Design</strong>&ndash; Inspired by tropical aesthetics, it combines palm trees, bright flowers, and lush greenery to create a feeling reminiscent of Hawaii.</p></li><li data-start=\"5989\" data-end=\"6136\"><p data-start=\"5991\" data-end=\"6136\"><strong data-start=\"5991\" data-end=\"6023\">Pavilion and Outdoor Kitchen</strong>&ndash; A fully equipped space for summer evenings, complete with fireplace for gatherings that last into the night.</p></li><li data-start=\"6137\" data-end=\"6250\"><p data-start=\"6139\" data-end=\"6250\"><strong data-start=\"6139\" data-end=\"6160\">Sports Facilities</strong>&ndash; A private badminton and floorball court brings recreation literally to your doorstep.</p></li><li data-start=\"6251\" data-end=\"6375\"><p data-start=\"6253\" data-end=\"6375\"><strong data-start=\"6253\" data-end=\"6279\">Outdoor Shower for Two</strong>&ndash; A detail that blends practicality with indulgence, adding to the villa&rsquo;s spa-like identity.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"6377\" data-end=\"6518\">&nbsp;</p><p data-start=\"6377\" data-end=\"6518\">Every inch of outdoor space is crafted to extend living beyond the villa&rsquo;s walls, ensuring both relaxation and activity are always at hand.</p><h2 data-start=\"8763\" data-end=\"8823\">Luxury Estate Turkey &ndash; Your Partner in Exclusive Living</h2><p data-start=\"8825\" data-end=\"9035\">At Luxury Estate Turkey, we know that purchasing a property like Villa Infinity is about more than square meters and features.

    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"319\" data-end=\"784\">You are in Alanya, a city that greets you with more than 300 days of sunshine every year. This<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/villas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">villa for sale in alanya</a>rises on a commanding 1000 m&sup2; land plot and unfolds into eight expansive rooms in a rare 6+2 layout&mdash;a format that perfectly blends multiple living areas with private retreats (you might have heard about the<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/blog/what-does-1-1-or-2-1-mean-in-turkey-guide-to-turkish-apartment-types-and-layouts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Turkish<em data-start=\"633\" data-end=\"648\">&ldquo;plus system&rdquo;</em>,</a>and yes, this is one of those homes where it matters). &nbsp;</p><p data-start=\"319\" data-end=\"784\">It&rsquo;s not just a villa&mdash;it&rsquo;s the kind of place that reminds you of hillside residences in Spain or villas on the French coast, yet it feels completely at home here in Turkey.</p><p data-start=\"786\" data-end=\"1107\">The moment you walk inside, the quality speaks for itself: marble floors that shine, wide glass panels that flood the rooms with light, and private wellness touches like a sauna and jacuzzi.</p><p data-start=\"786\" data-end=\"1107\">Outside, the terraces stretch toward the castle, the mountains, and the sea, giving you the kind of view you never get tired of.</p><p data-start=\"1109\" data-end=\"1330\">And even with all this privacy, you&rsquo;re still only 4 km from the shoreline and just a short drive from the city center. Close enough for daily life, but far enough to feel like you&rsquo;ve stepped into your own private world.</p><h2>Inside this villa in Alanya: Everyday Life with Hotel Comforts</h2><h3>Prestige in Every Step</h3><p>The villa is finished throughout with polished marble floors. They don&rsquo;t just brighten the rooms, they also give that immediate sense of quality the moment you step in. It&rsquo;s a surface that feels solid underfoot and instantly sets the tone for the whole house.</p><h3>A Living Room Made for Arrival</h3><p>The main salon looks like it could belong to a boutique hotel. Grey sectional sofas fill the space comfortably, with subtle gold details adding a touch of shine. Deep blue armchairs break the monotony and bring a richer atmosphere. It&rsquo;s not a room that feels &ldquo;decorated&rdquo;&mdash;it feels like it was put together with intention. You don&rsquo;t just enter the living room, you arrive into it.</p><h3>Lighting that Works with Mood</h3><p>Recessed spotlights and slim wall lamps create layers of light. In the evening, the house doesn&rsquo;t just get brighter&mdash;it softens into a warm glow. The design is minimal, but never cold. It gives the house the kind of mood you&rsquo;d expect from a high-end city hotel, only this time there&rsquo;s no checkout desk waiting for you.</p><h3>Stairs with Character</h3><p>The staircase, framed in glass, isn&rsquo;t hidden away. It stands as a central piece that visually connects the levels. Rather than being just functional, it works like part of the architecture, reminding you that<strong>every corner of this villa in Alanya was considered.</strong></p><h3>Bedrooms that Open to the View</h3><p>Each bedroom uses wide glass panels to keep the scenery in front of you. The furniture is kept deliberately neutral so nothing competes with the outside. From the bed you see the city, the castle, and the sea. It&rsquo;s the kind of view that makes you close your eyes at night with the skyline still on your mind.</p><h3>Bathrooms Made for More Than Routine</h3><p>The bathrooms go well beyond being practical. One holds a jacuzzi facing the horizon, another includes a sauna finished in natural wood. They&rsquo;re not designed just for daily routines&mdash;they&rsquo;re spaces for slowing down, unwinding, and giving yourself time, almost like having a private spa inside your own home.</p><h2 data-start=\"3167\" data-end=\"3218\">Outdoor Spaces in this villa in Alanya made for Living, Not Just Looking!</h2><p data-start=\"3220\" data-end=\"3554\">Step outside, and the villa&rsquo;s panoramic terrace stretches wide enough to host a dinner for twenty<strong>without anyone feeling squeezed.</strong></p><p data-start=\"3220\" data-end=\"3554\">The private pool sits in front, lined with glass to protect the view of the sea and Alanya Castle.</p><p data-start=\"3220\" data-end=\"3554\">A landscaped garden adds greenery, softening the grand stone and marble touches with a natural rhythm.</p><p data-start=\"269\" data-end=\"730\">There&rsquo;s space here not just for sunbeds, but for a way of living. Imagine the kids splashing in the pool while grandparents relax under the pergola with their tea. Friends gather for a barbecue that slowly turns into an evening of laughter. And if you feel like taking it up a notch, this garden in this villa in Alanya, can easily host a summer party everyone in Alanya talks about&mdash;bring in a DJ, light up the terrace, and the 1000 m&sup2; plot suddenly feels like your own private venue.</p><p data-start=\"732\" data-end=\"897\">This isn&rsquo;t just a villa with outdoor space. It&rsquo;s a villa where life naturally flows outside, where every corner is designed to be lived in, shared, and remembered.</p><h2 data-start=\"3877\" data-end=\"3904\">Who This Villa in Alanya Might Speaks To?</h2><p data-start=\"3906\" data-end=\"4005\">Not every property in Alanya is designed for everyone.<strong>This one makes its audience crystal clear.</strong></p><h3 data-start=\"4007\" data-end=\"4047\">Upper-Income Buyers Seeking Prestige</h3><p data-start=\"4048\" data-end=\"4204\">For those who want a home that declares status the moment you open the door, this villa has all the signals: space, marble, views, and an address in Tepe.</p><h3 data-start=\"4206\" data-end=\"4248\">Foreign Investors with an Eye on Value</h3><p data-start=\"4249\" data-end=\"4499\">A villa in Alanya like this does<strong>more than shine on social media</strong>. It delivers serious rental potential&mdash;whether as a seasonal retreat for high-end vacationers or as a long-term investment that grows in value alongside Alanya&rsquo;s luxury market.</p><h3 data-start=\"4501\" data-end=\"4519\">Large Families</h3><p data-start=\"4520\" data-end=\"4767\">With 8 rooms, a private garden, children&rsquo;s pool, and secure surroundings, this villa is almost tailor-made for families who need both space and peace of mind. Everyone gets a room, but the family still comes together around the pool and terrace.</p><h3 data-start=\"4769\" data-end=\"4792\">Second-Home Seekers</h3><p data-start=\"4793\" data-end=\"4953\">For those who want a prestigious summer home in Alanya away from the buzz of downtown yet still within 20 minutes of it, this villa offers the perfect middle ground.</p><h3 data-start=\"4955\" data-end=\"4989\">Wellness &amp; Comfort Enthusiasts</h3><p data-start=\"4990\" data-end=\"5163\">If spa rituals, private fitness, and relaxation are your lifestyle priorities, the villa&rsquo;s sauna, jacuzzi, and pool deliver exactly that&mdash;without stepping foot in a resort.</p><h2 data-start=\"6708\" data-end=\"6756\">Investment Potential of this villa in Alanya that goes beyond numbers</h2><p data-start=\"6758\" data-end=\"6939\">Luxury property in Alanya continues to attract international attention. Villas in Tepe, with their larger land plots and panoramic views, stand out as rare and secure investments.</p><p data-start=\"6941\" data-end=\"7021\">Consider this villa as more than just a home&mdash;it&rsquo;s also a financial instrument:</p><ul data-start=\"7023\" data-end=\"7420\"><li data-start=\"7023\" data-end=\"7161\"><p data-start=\"7025\" data-end=\"7161\"><strong data-start=\"7025\" data-end=\"7048\">High Rental Income:</strong>Seasonal rentals in Alanya often command strong rates, especially for villas with private pools and sea views.</p></li><li data-start=\"7162\" data-end=\"7271\"><p data-start=\"7164\" data-end=\"7271\"><strong data-start=\"7164\" data-end=\"7181\">Resale Value:</strong>With the city growing, villas in elevated neighborhoods like Tepe hold long-term value.</p></li><li data-start=\"7272\" data-end=\"7420\"><p data-start=\"7274\" data-end=\"7420\"><strong data-start=\"7274\" data-end=\"7304\">Citizenship Opportunities:</strong>Properties of this scale also open doors for Turkish citizenship, an advantage many foreign buyers actively seek.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"7422\" data-end=\"7561\">Buying here isn&rsquo;t simply about personal comfort.

With a generous living space of 313 m&sup2;, a total of 4 rooms including 3 bedrooms and 1 living room with open kitchen, and a design that balances showpiece glamour with family practicality, this villa offers a Mediterranean lifestyle at its finest. Located just 900 meters from the beach, it provides the perfect blend of coastal proximity, mountain views, and private resort-style amenities.</p><h2>Mahmutlar &ndash; A District Where Everyday Life Meets Holiday Spirit</h2><p>Mahmutlar lies along the Alanya coastline, nestled between the Mediterranean Sea and the Taurus Mountains. It is one of Alanya&rsquo;s most developed and expat-friendly districts, with a large international community that gives it a cosmopolitan yet relaxed atmosphere.</p><p>The district stretches for several kilometers, meaning you can find both lively areas with caf&eacute;s, shops, and restaurants, as well as quieter zones closer to the mountains. Only 10 km from Alanya city center, Mahmutlar allows residents to enjoy peaceful daily life while remaining close to the vibrant social and commercial heart of Alanya.</p><h3>Lifestyle Advantages in Mahmutlar</h3><ul><li><p><strong>Beaches and Water Sports:</strong>Mahmutlar&rsquo;s coastline offers sandy beaches perfect for swimming, sunbathing, and water sports. Fishing is also popular along the piers and rocky spots.</p></li><li><p><strong>Nature and Mountains:</strong>The Taurus foothills behind Mahmutlar invite residents to hike, picnic, or simply breathe in fresh mountain air.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness and Wellness:</strong>The area offers gyms, hamams, yoga studios, and cycling routes, making it easy to lead a healthy lifestyle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shopping and Daily Conveniences:</strong>While YektaMall and Akdeniz Park shopping centers provide modern retail options, traditional butchers, bakeries, and hardware stores are scattered throughout the town.

Recognized as one of Alanya&rsquo;s most complete developments, it blends the privileges of a five-star hotel with the privacy of your own home. This is not just another<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/luxury\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong data-start=\"518\" data-end=\"557\">luxury apartment for sale in Alanya</strong></a>; it&rsquo;s a lifestyle designed to indulge you in every detail. Moreover, with eligibility for<strong data-start=\"648\" data-end=\"685\">Turkish citizenship by investment</strong>, it offers not only a dream home but also a strategic opportunity for your future.</p><p data-start=\"633\" data-end=\"1089\">&nbsp;</p><p data-start=\"772\" data-end=\"1367\">For most people, resort facilities are reserved for a one-week holiday. At Riviera Imperial Deluxe, they become part of everyday living: spa treatments, a private cinema, sports courts, indoor and outdoor pools, fine dining, and concierge-style services &mdash; all available within your own complex. Step inside the apartment itself and you&rsquo;ll notice rare touches, such as a private jacuzzi in the master bathroom, which lift this home far above the ordinary. And with the added advantage of securing<strong data-start=\"1268\" data-end=\"1291\">Turkish citizenship</strong>, this property combines lifestyle luxury with long-term investment value.</p><h2>Inside the Apartment &ndash; Luxury with Personality</h2><p>With a total area of<strong>152 m&sup2;</strong>, this four-room apartment balances spaciousness with elegance. Its plan includes a large living area, three bedrooms, and carefully designed bathrooms &mdash; one of which has been redeveloped to include a jacuzzi not found in other units of the complex.</p><p><strong>Design Language</strong></p><ul><li><p><strong>Modern-Luxury</strong>: Golden ceiling panels and bespoke LED lighting fixtures create a sleek, contemporary aesthetic.</p></li><li><p><strong>Minimalist yet Opulent</strong>: Walls are finished in light, neutral shades, while selective use of textured stone and decorative ceilings add richness.</p></li><li><p><strong>Functional Comfort</strong>: Floor heating throughout the apartment ensures warmth in all seasons, while wide glass fa&ccedil;ades flood the rooms with natural light.</p></li></ul><p>The result is an interior that feels at once calm and glamorous &mdash; a home that is just as suitable for daily family life as it is for entertaining guests.</p><h2>A Complex That Leaves Nothing Out</h2><p>Calling Riviera Imperial Deluxe a residential project feels almost modest. It is closer to a private holiday village, where every possible amenity is provided.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Wellness &amp; Spa</strong>: Turkish bath, sauna, steam room, salt room, massage facilities, and indoor pool.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sports &amp; Leisure</strong>: Football and basketball courts, tennis, mini-football, fitness center, table tennis, billiards, and cycling areas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Family-Oriented Facilities</strong>: Children&rsquo;s pools, playgrounds, kids&rsquo; rooms, and waterslides that make every day feel like a holiday for younger residents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Social Life</strong>: A cinema, restaurant, caf&eacute;, lobby, meeting rooms, and pavilions bring residents together.</p></li><li><p><strong>Hotel Services</strong>: 24/7 reception, cleaning services, guest rooms for visitors, and security systems that ensure peace of mind.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Comfort</strong>: Generators, panoramic elevators, parking options, and high-speed internet zones.</p></li></ul><p>With such a range of amenities, it is no exaggeration to say: living here feels like living in a self-contained luxury resort.</p><h2>Why Kargıcak Makes a Difference</h2><p>The apartment gains even more appeal thanks to its setting in<strong>Kargıcak</strong>. This neighborhood of Alanya offers a slower rhythm than the city center, with clean beaches, open landscapes, and easy access to both Mahmutlar and Alanya.</p><ul><li><p>Residents enjoy quiet surroundings without being isolated.</p></li><li><p>Public transport links (bus lines 1, 2, and 3) connect Kargıcak to the city in about twenty minutes.</p></li><li><p>Restaurants range from traditional Turkish family kitchens to seafront fish eateries and European-inspired venues near the hotels.</p></li><li><p>Outdoor activities like cycling, horse riding, and diving are close at hand, while Dim&ccedil;ayı and Dim Cave are easy day trips.</p></li></ul><p>Kargıcak appeals especially to those who want to blend everyday convenience with a lifestyle tied to nature and the sea.</p><h2>Who Will Find This Apartment Ideal?</h2><h3>Investors</h3><p>Riviera Imperial Deluxe offers some of the strongest rental potential in Alanya. Its scale, amenities, and services attract both long-term residents and holiday renters, ensuring reliable returns.</p><h3>Citizenship Seekers</h3><p>With its size and price segment, this apartment qualifies for the<strong>Turkish Citizenship by Investment</strong>program &mdash; a key advantage for international buyers seeking both a lifestyle upgrade and a second passport.</p><h3>Families</h3><p>Four spacious rooms, children&rsquo;s play zones, pools, and sports fields make this apartment perfect for family living. Parents gain peace of mind from on-site services, while children enjoy resort-style freedom.</p><h3>Comfort-Oriented Buyers</h3><p>For those who measure quality of life not only in square meters but in services and experiences, this property delivers. From the private jacuzzi to the on-site cinema and spa, the everyday becomes extraordinary.</p><h2>An Investment That Blends Prestige and Practicality</h2><p>Unlike many apartments in Alanya, this home offers both tangible financial value and intangible prestige. The rare combination of<strong>luxury hotel services and private ownership</strong>ensures that demand will remain strong, both for renting and resale. Moreover, its unique features &mdash; such as the custom jacuzzi &mdash; add individuality, making it stand out even within its own complex.</p><h2>A Partner You Can Trust</h2><p>Buying a property of this caliber requires guidance and reliability. At Luxury Estate Turkey, we make the process straightforward, transparent, and secure.</p><ul><li><p><strong>In-Depth Market Knowledge</strong>: We explain every neighborhood with clarity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and Administrative Support</strong>: From title deeds to citizenship applications, every step is handled.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored Property Search</strong>: We match clients with homes that truly fit their goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sales Services</strong>: Rental management, resale consultancy, and property care keep your investment protected.</p></li><li><p><strong>Inspection Trips</strong>: For international buyers, we arrange visits to experience properties and surroundings firsthand.</p></li></ul><p>With us, you gain not only a property but a lasting partnership &mdash; one that prioritizes your comfort, safety, and profitability.</p><p>This<strong>4 room, 152 m&sup2; apartment in Riviera Imperial Deluxe</strong>combines the exclusivity of citizenship eligibility, the comfort of a luxury hotel, and the security of a well-managed residential complex.
