This beautiful duplex penthouse at<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Alanya</strong></a>Arcadia Residence is one of those rare discoveries &ndash; a home that combines the space and comfort of a house with all the conveniences of modern apartment living, right in the heart of one of Alanya's most sought-after neighborhoods, Mahmutlar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Mahmutlar has this wonderful way of making everyone feel welcome. It's become incredibly popular with international families and couples who want that perfect blend of Mediterranean charm and modern convenience. The area buzzes with life &ndash; you've got everything from traditional Turkish markets to international restaurants, all within a community that genuinely feels like home rather than just another tourist destination.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">This particular penthouse stands out for all the right reasons. With its two-storey layout featuring 2 bedrooms and a spacious living area that flows into an American-style kitchen, it's designed for real life. Whether you're hosting friends for dinner, enjoying quiet family evenings, or working from home, every space serves a purpose while maintaining that airy, comfortable feeling that makes Mediterranean living so special.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">What really sets this place apart is how everything just works together.<strong>You're only 450 meters from the beach</strong>&ndash; close enough that a morning swim or sunset walk becomes part of your daily routine, not a special occasion. The large balcony with city views gives you that outdoor living space that transforms how you experience each day. And because it comes fully furnished with all the modern conveniences, you could literally move in tomorrow and start enjoying this lifestyle immediately.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The Arcadia Residence complex itself feels more like a resort than just an apartment building, with facilities that mean you never have to go far for relaxation or entertainment. For families looking for space and security, couples seeking their perfect Mediterranean retreat, or investors recognizing the enduring appeal of this location, this penthouse offers something that's increasingly hard to find &ndash; a home that enhances your life from day one.</p><h2><strong>A Home in Alanya That Actually Feels Like Home</strong></h2><h3><strong>Walking Through the Front Door</strong></h3><p>The first thing you notice when you step inside is how bright and welcoming everything feels. The entrance hall is surprisingly spacious &ndash; none of that cramped apartment feeling you sometimes get. The light ceramic floors really help bounce the natural light around, and there's plenty of built-in storage right from the get-go, which honestly makes such a difference in daily life.</p><h3><strong>The Living Space Where Life Happens</strong></h3><p>The living room is where this place really comes alive. Those big glass doors flood the space with light all day long, and the way it opens up into the kitchen means you're never stuck cooking alone while everyone else is watching TV. It's got that easy flow that makes entertaining feel natural rather than forced.</p><p>The L-shaped sofa is perfect for family movie nights or having friends over, and everything's kept pretty simple design-wise so it doesn't feel cluttered. The best part is how you can just step right out onto the balcony from here &ndash; it's like having an extra room that happens to be outdoors.</p><h3><strong>Kitchen That Works for Real Cooking</strong></h3><p>The kitchen is one of those American-style setups that actually makes sense. The white cabinets keep everything feeling fresh and bright, while the black countertops are practical enough to handle real cooking without showing every little mark. There's a nice mosaic backsplash that adds some character without being too busy.</p><p>Everything you need is built right in &ndash; oven, stove, the works. Plus there's a little dining table right there, which is perfect for quick breakfasts or when you want to chat with whoever's cooking.</p><h3><strong>Master Bedroom With a View</strong></h3><p>The main bedroom is genuinely spacious &ndash; you could fit a proper king-size bed without the room feeling cramped. What really makes it special are those glass doors that open onto the balcony. Imagine waking up to natural light and city views every morning. The furniture is elegant but not fussy, and there's plenty of storage space.</p><h3><strong>Second Bedroom That Actually Works</strong></h3><p>The second bedroom might be smaller, but it's thoughtfully laid out. With the two single beds, it works perfectly for kids or guests. They've kept the design neutral so you could easily make it your own &ndash; maybe turn it into an office or hobby room if you don't need the extra sleeping space.</p><h3><strong>The Balcony &ndash; Your Outdoor Living Room</strong></h3><p>This is where the penthouse really shines. The balcony is huge &ndash; big enough to set up proper outdoor furniture and use it like another room. You could have breakfast out there, work on your laptop, or host dinner parties under the stars. The city views give you something interesting to look at, and being up high means you get great privacy and fresh air.</p><p>For anyone coming from a colder climate, this balcony becomes your year-round outdoor space &ndash; something that completely changes how you live.</p><h2 data-start=\"6117\" data-end=\"6177\">Social and Residence Features in Arcadia Residence,Alanya</h2><p data-start=\"6179\" data-end=\"6278\">Arcadia Residence is not just an apartment complex but a community offering resort-like features:</p><ul data-start=\"6279\" data-end=\"6674\"><li data-start=\"6279\" data-end=\"6304\"><p data-start=\"6281\" data-end=\"6304\">Outdoor swimming pool</p></li><li data-start=\"6305\" data-end=\"6339\"><p data-start=\"6307\" data-end=\"6339\">Children&rsquo;s pool and playground</p></li><li data-start=\"6340\" data-end=\"6379\"><p data-start=\"6342\" data-end=\"6379\">Sauna and steam room for relaxation</p></li><li data-start=\"6380\" data-end=\"6422\"><p data-start=\"6382\" data-end=\"6422\">Fitness center for an active lifestyle</p></li><li data-start=\"6423\" data-end=\"6462\"><p data-start=\"6425\" data-end=\"6462\">Barbecue area for social gatherings</p></li><li data-start=\"6463\" data-end=\"6498\"><p data-start=\"6465\" data-end=\"6498\">24/7 security and camera system</p></li><li data-start=\"6499\" data-end=\"6521\"><p data-start=\"6501\" data-end=\"6521\">Caretaker services</p></li><li data-start=\"6522\" data-end=\"6539\"><p data-start=\"6524\" data-end=\"6539\">Open car park</p></li><li data-start=\"6540\" data-end=\"6584\"><p data-start=\"6542\" data-end=\"6584\">Generator for uninterrupted power supply</p></li><li data-start=\"6585\" data-end=\"6626\"><p data-start=\"6587\" data-end=\"6626\">Cable TV and satellite infrastructure</p></li><li data-start=\"6627\" data-end=\"6674\"><p data-start=\"6629\" data-end=\"6674\">Proximity to bus stops for easy connections</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"6676\" data-end=\"6792\">These features ensure that both full-time residents and holiday visitors enjoy comfort, safety, and entertainment.</p><h2 data-start=\"6799\" data-end=\"6842\">Who Is This Apartment Best Suited For?</h2><h3 data-start=\"6844\" data-end=\"6858\">Families</h3><p data-start=\"6859\" data-end=\"7089\">With two bedrooms and a spacious living area, the apartment is perfect for families with children.

With 3 rooms (two bedrooms and a spacious living room with an open kitchen), a balcony, and high-end furniture, the apartment is move-in ready. Combined with its excellent location just 300 meters from the beach, the property appeals to families, seasonal residents, and investors alike.</p><h2 data-start=\"1062\" data-end=\"1126\">Mahmutlar &ndash; A Peaceful and International District of Alanya</h2><p data-start=\"1128\" data-end=\"1414\">Mahmutlar stretches along the Mediterranean coastline, framed by sandy beaches on one side and the Taurus Mountains on the other. The district lies only 10 km east of Alanya center, yet it has grown into a self-sufficient town where everything you need for daily life is within reach.</p><p data-start=\"1416\" data-end=\"1816\">The area is especially popular among foreigners. An expat community thrives here, creating an international atmosphere where locals and newcomers share the same caf&eacute;s, markets, and public spaces. Weekly markets, such as the Tuesday bazaar, offer fresh fruits, vegetables, local cheeses, and spices. Meanwhile, supermarkets, butchers, bakeries, and hardware stores are scattered throughout the town.</p><p data-start=\"1818\" data-end=\"2233\">Moreover, Mahmutlar&rsquo;s long coastline provides easy access to sandy beaches and water sports, while the backstreets lead to the foothills of the Taurus Mountains. This unique combination allows residents to enjoy both beach days and mountain hikes. Families appreciate the wide choice of playgrounds, gyms, and hamams, while cycling enthusiasts use the well-planned routes along the coast and into the countryside.</p><p data-start=\"2235\" data-end=\"2587\">Transportation is frequent and convenient. Local minibuses run every few minutes to Alanya center, while taxis are available almost everywhere. Shopping centers such as Yekta Mall and Akdeniz Park ensure that modern retail options are within easy reach, and a growing variety of caf&eacute;s and restaurants&mdash;including international chains&mdash;enrich daily life.</p><p data-start=\"2589\" data-end=\"2750\">Consequently, Mahmutlar has become one of Alanya&rsquo;s most desirable districts, balancing calm residential comfort with vibrant tourism and international culture.</p><h2 data-start=\"2752\" data-end=\"2811\">Interior Design &ndash; Modern, Luxurious, and Move-In Ready</h2><p data-start=\"2813\" data-end=\"3032\">This<strong data-start=\"2818\" data-end=\"2851\">3 room apartment in Mahmutlar</strong>spans 95 m&sup2; and comes fully furnished with a modern and luxurious design.

A light-colored L-shaped sofa brings freshness and spaciousness to the room. The curtains combine sheer tulle with heavy drapes, offering both elegance and practical light control.</p><p data-start=\"3363\" data-end=\"3679\">The kitchen stands out with its bold contrast of white cabinets and black accents. A sleek black glass backsplash gives the space a contemporary edge, while the glossy surfaces reflect light and add depth. The dining area introduces a vibrant touch with mustard-yellow chairs, which energize the entire atmosphere.</p><h3 data-start=\"3681\" data-end=\"3730\">Bedrooms &ndash; Style and Functionality Combined</h3><ul data-start=\"3732\" data-end=\"4260\"><li data-start=\"3732\" data-end=\"4016\"><p data-start=\"3734\" data-end=\"4016\"><strong data-start=\"3734\" data-end=\"3753\">Master Bedroom:</strong>Designed in sophisticated grey and orange tones, the master bedroom includes a marble-patterned wall panel behind the bed, creating a luxurious focal point.

Caf&eacute;s, restaurants, and shops are equally close, ensuring that everything is at your fingertips.</p><p data-start=\"6065\" data-end=\"6375\">Furthermore, bus stops nearby connect you to Alanya center within 10&ndash;15 minutes, making it easy to access the city&rsquo;s vibrant shopping streets, marina, and cultural attractions.

    "property_title": "Affordable Apartment in Alanya Castle area",
    "property_description": "<div><p>When searching for apartments for sale in Alanya, most buyers expect high prices due to its unique location inside the historic peninsula. However, this furnished 4 room apartment with 110 m&sup2; living space and only 400 meters from the sea stands out as a cheap apartment in Alanya Castle compared to other homes in the area. It offers a balance of affordability, history, and lifestyle &mdash; making it suitable both for families and investors.</p><h2 data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">Interior Design and the Living Atmosphere in this Apartment in Alanya</h2><p>This apartment already has a distinctive soul. Rather than a sterile, brand-new feeling, it delivers an authentic atmosphere:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Living Room</strong>: Traditional Turkish rugs, ethnic cushions, and classic wall decorations create a warm, lived-in vibe. The seating is comfortable though a bit aged, with bright tones adding freshness. Buyers seeking a modern touch may consider reupholstery or new furniture, but the current setup is fully usable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kitchen</strong>: A separate kitchen is a significant advantage. Cabinets are classic in design but could benefit from updated doors and tiles. With a light renovation, the kitchen can be transformed into a bright and functional space.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bedrooms</strong>: One bedroom radiates bohemian energy with vibrant colors, sun-patterned textiles, and playful curtains. The second bedroom offers simplicity with plain tones and a white headboard, ideal for those who prefer a minimalist style.</p></li><li><p><strong>Overall Style</strong>: A charming mix of traditional Anatolian rugs, bohemian accessories, and retro furniture defines the apartment. While it is perfectly livable as it is, modernization opportunities remain.</p></li></ul><p>For buyers seeking an<strong>apartment with a view of Alanya Castle</strong>, this home offers city, mountain, and partial sea views, giving a taste of both history and nature.</p><h2>Property Features</h2><ul><li><p>Furnished 4 room apartment (2 bedrooms + 1 living room + 1 separate kitchen)</p></li><li><p>110 m&sup2; interior space</p></li><li><p>400 meters to the sea</p></li><li><p>City, mountain, and partial sea views</p></li><li><p>White goods and electric water heater</p></li><li><p>Cash payment discount available</p></li><li><p>High rental potential for short-term holiday lets</p></li><li><p>Renovation potential for increased value</p></li></ul><h3>Building Features</h3><ul><li><p>24/7 security cameras</p></li><li><p>Caretaker service</p></li><li><p>Barbecue area</p></li><li><p>Cable TV and satellite system</p></li><li><p>Close to the beach</p></li><li>Located inside the historical center</li></ul><h2><strong data-start=\"736\" data-end=\"784\">Why Choose the Alanya Castle Neighborhood?</strong></h2><p><strong>Buying a historic house in Alanya</strong>is not just about owning a property; it is about living inside UNESCO heritage. The peninsula divides Alanya into east and west, creating panoramic views of the Mediterranean and Taurus Mountains. Within walking distance, you have access to:</p><ul><li><p>The famous Red Tower (Kızıl Kule)</p></li><li><p>The historic shipyard (Tersane)</p></li><li><p>Damlataş Cave and Cleopatra Beach via cable car</p></li><li><p>Local souvenir shops, authentic caf&eacute;s, and restaurants with castle views</p></li></ul><p>This unique lifestyle cannot be replicated in newer districts. Living here means morning walks among ancient castle walls and evenings spent in traditional restaurants overlooking the sea.</p><h2>Lifestyle Benefits for Different Buyers</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Families</strong>: Spacious 110 m&sup2; plan with multiple rooms, close to schools and city services.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>: An<strong>apartment for investment in Alanya</strong>with high rental income from tourists seeking historic stays.</p></li><li><p><strong>Foreign Buyers</strong>: The charm of living in a historic area combined with easy access to the beach and city center.</p></li><li><p><strong>Young Couples and Digital Nomads</strong>: Move-in ready with furniture included, and potential to renovate for a modern, personalized style.</p></li></ul><h2>Everyday Life in Alanya Castle</h2><p>Life in this neighborhood combines peace with practicality. Although daily needs can be met with small local markets, the city center is just a short walk away for larger supermarkets and shopping. Public transport, taxis, and even the cable car ensure easy access.</p><p>Caf&eacute;s and restaurants in Kale Mahallesi are especially popular for their traditional breakfasts and romantic dinners. Imagine enjoying Turkish tea on your balcony with the castle walls in the background &mdash; this is everyday life here.</p><h2>Investment Potential</h2><p>The Alanya Castle area has limited housing supply due to its protected status. That scarcity creates value:</p><ul><li><p>Properties in the historic center appreciate steadily over time.</p></li><li><p>Strong demand for short-term holiday rentals ensures high occupancy rates.</p></li><li><p>Renovation can boost both capital value and rental returns.</p></li></ul><p>For those looking for a<strong>cheap apartment in Alanya Castle</strong>with room to add value, this property offers the perfect entry point.</p><h2>Renovation Potential and Advisory</h2><p>While fully livable, some areas could be modernized for extra comfort:</p><ul><li><p>Kitchen cabinet doors and tiles</p></li><li><p>Furniture updates in the living room</p></li><li><p>Bathroom refresh for modern fittings</p></li></ul><p>Instead of estimating costs upfront, buyers are encouraged to consult directly with<strong>Luxury Estate Turkey</strong>. Our team offers renovation advisory services, including:</p><ul><li><p>Evaluating the property&rsquo;s renovation potential</p></li><li><p>Connecting buyers with reliable contractors</p></li><li><p>Offering cost scenarios and timeline planning</p></li></ul><p>This ensures that buyers can make informed decisions without guesswork.</p><h2>Why Work with Luxury Estate Turkey?</h2><p>Purchasing property in Turkey, especially in a historic area, requires trusted guidance. Luxury Estate Turkey acts as your reliable partner throughout the process:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Legal Expertise</strong>: We provide full assistance with title deed transfer, notary approvals, and government registrations.</p></li><li><p><strong>Foreign Buyer Support</strong>: Guidance for residence permits and Turkish citizenship through property investment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Secure Transactions</strong>: Transparent pricing, verified documents, and safe payment handling.</p></li><li><p><strong>Renovation Advisory</strong>: Helping clients understand potential renovation costs and connecting them with trustworthy service providers.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sale Services</strong>: Property management, rental income consultation, and ongoing client support.</p></li></ul><p>Our experience in the Alanya market ensures realistic advice.

Being only 600 meters from the shoreline&mdash;around a pleasant 10-minute walk&mdash;means you can head to the beach for a swim, enjoy the sunset, or meet friends at a seaside caf&eacute; without even thinking about parking or transport.</p><p data-start=\"705\" data-end=\"954\">The complex sits on a 3,030 m&sup2; plot and includes 58 apartments, planned with a focus on both style and practicality. Shared facilities are designed to make daily living more enjoyable, from relaxation areas to spaces that bring neighbors together.</p><p data-start=\"956\" data-end=\"1386\">What makes this location appealing is its balance: you&rsquo;re close to supermarkets, shops, restaurants, and all the essentials, yet the beach is practically part of your daily routine.

    "property_description": "<div><p>Homes with this much space and sunlight are hard to find&mdash;this one offers both, just minutes from the sea.</p><h2>Spacious 2 Room Apartment for Sale in Kurt Safir Euro 6 Alanya &ndash; Fully Furnished and 5 Minutes from the Beach</h2><p>This impressive 2 room<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/apartments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apartment for sale in Alanya</a>is nestled in the vibrant heart of Mahmutlar, inside the modern Kurt Safir Euro 6 Residence. Unlike most flats in its class, this property stands out with an<strong>expansive 130 m&sup2; of living space</strong>, a fully separate kitchen, 3 bathrooms, and 2 balconies.</p><p><strong>Only 400 meters from the Mediterranean coast</strong>&mdash;about a 5-minute walk&mdash;this apartment is a rare opportunity for those seeking both space and location. As a result, it's ideal for families, long-term residents, and investors alike.</p><h2>Location &amp; Lifestyle &ndash; Where Mahmutlar Meets Everyday Comfort</h2><p>Located in Mahmutlar, one of the most internationally popular areas for<strong>property for sale in Alanya</strong>, this apartment offers the perfect balance of quiet coastal living and urban accessibility. The district has earned a reputation for being<strong>expat-friendly, relaxed, and well-connected</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, the beach is just a short stroll away, making daily swims, long walks, or sunset views part of your routine. On the other hand, if you prefer staying local, you&rsquo;ll find caf&eacute;s, markets, and bakeries only a block or two away.</p><p>In addition, the public bus system runs every 10 minutes into Alanya center, and taxis are easily available throughout the day. Therefore, whether you&rsquo;re heading to a museum, beach bar, or simply running errands, everything is within easy reach.</p><h2>Apartment Details &ndash; Rare Size and Practical Layout</h2><p>This<strong>130 m&sup2; 2 room apartment</strong>provides a layout that emphasizes privacy and comfort. Thanks to its<strong>southeast-facing orientation</strong>, the apartment is filled with sunlight for most of the day&mdash;particularly enjoyable during winter months.</p><h3>Key Highlights:</h3><ul><li><strong>Total Area:</strong>130 m&sup2; (rare for 2 room flats in Alanya)</li><li><strong>Rooms:</strong>1 spacious bedroom + 1 bright living room</li><li><strong>Kitchen:</strong>Fully separate, with modern appliances and breakfast nook</li><li><strong>Bathrooms:</strong>3 in total, perfect for guest privacy</li><li><strong>Balconies:</strong>2 large balconies with city and mountain views</li><li><strong>Storage:</strong>Dedicated pantry/storage room inside the flat</li><li><strong>Orientation:</strong>South and east-facing for optimal light</li><li><strong>Condition:</strong>Fully furnished and move-in ready</li></ul><p>Equally important, the layout is ideal for both permanent living and short-term rentals.

The living room transitions into a uniquely defined<strong>dining room</strong>, separated by a stylish archway&mdash;perfect for hosting dinners or enjoying quiet meals with family.</p><h3>Kitchen:</h3><p>The<strong>separate kitchen</strong>is a real highlight. Outfitted in<strong>elegant grey cabinetry</strong>with white countertops and built-in appliances, it offers functionality and charm. A breakfast table by the window makes mornings more enjoyable.

Whether you're sipping coffee in the morning or enjoying an evening breeze, these outdoor areas bring in fresh air and mountain views.</p><h2>On-Site Facilities &ndash; More Than Just a Home</h2><p>The<strong>Kurt Safir Euro 6 Residence</strong>offers a suite of luxury amenities designed to enhance daily life. Consequently, you'll feel like you're living in a private resort&mdash;without leaving your home.</p><h3>Available Facilities:</h3><ul><li>Large outdoor swimming pool and separate children&rsquo;s pool</li><li>Modern fitness center</li><li>Sauna and wellness area</li><li>Children&rsquo;s playground and green shaded rest areas</li><li>Barbecue space for gatherings</li><li>On-site caretaker and maintenance staff</li><li>24/7 security camera system</li><li>Power generator and satellite TV infrastructure</li><li>Secure on-site car parking</li></ul><p>Moreover, all facilities are well-maintained and easy to access, making this residence ideal for year-round living or seasonal stays.</p><h2>Mahmutlar &ndash; Alanya&rsquo;s Most Convenient and Friendly District</h2><p>Mahmutlar offers more than just beautiful beaches&mdash;it&rsquo;s a neighborhood full of character. In contrast to more touristic areas, Mahmutlar remains relaxed even in high season, while still providing everything you need.</p><p><strong>Why Mahmutlar Stands Out:</strong></p><ul><li>Flat terrain, perfect for walking and cycling</li><li>Proximity to Toros Mountains for hikes and picnics</li><li>Dozens of local caf&eacute;s and restaurants, both Turkish and international</li><li>Weekly outdoor market (Tuesdays) for fresh produce</li><li>Close to YektaMall and Akdeniz Park shopping centers</li><li>Wide range of clinics, pharmacies, and banks nearby</li><li>Efficient public transport and quick access to Alanya center</li></ul><p>As a result, Mahmutlar remains the top choice for those looking for an<strong>Alanya apartment for sale</strong>that&rsquo;s both practical and vibrant.</p><h2>Who Is This Apartment Perfect For?</h2><p>This<strong>spacious 2 room apartment in Alanya</strong>is perfect for:</p><ul><li><strong>Families</strong>needing generous space and privacy</li><li><strong>Retirees</strong>who prefer sunny weather and walkability</li><li><strong>Investors</strong>seeking high rental potential with furnished convenience</li><li><strong>Holiday home buyers</strong>who want comfort and proximity to the sea</li><li><strong>Remote workers</strong>looking for quiet surroundings and inspiring views</li></ul><p>With its size, layout, and location, this apartment outshines many others in its category.</p><h2>Why Work with Luxury Estate Turkey?</h2><p>We know that buying a home in Turkey is about more than just location or size&mdash;it&rsquo;s about lifestyle.

    "property_title": "Close to sea “Scandi-Turkish” Apartment for Sale in Oba, Alanya",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>Bigger Than Your Average 2-Room &ndash; And That&rsquo;s Just the Beginning</h2><p>Let&rsquo;s be honest. If you&rsquo;ve been looking at 2-room<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/apartments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apartments in Alanya</a>for a while, you probably have apartment size fatigue. They&rsquo;re almost always around 45 to 50 m&sup2;. You see the photos, nod politely, and think,<em>Sure, nice place&hellip; if I don&rsquo;t mind doing a three-point turn between the sofa and the kitchen table</em>.</p><p>Well, this one&rsquo;s different. At<strong>70 m&sup2;</strong>, it&rsquo;s basically the &ldquo;grande&rdquo; version of a 2-room home&mdash;without the extra shot of espresso price tag. And that extra 20+ m&sup2;? It&rsquo;s not just numbers on a floor plan. It&rsquo;s the difference between squeezing in a dining table or actually hosting dinner without asking your guests to balance plates on their knees.</p><p>Oh, and did I mention it&rsquo;s just<strong>300 meters from the beach</strong>? That&rsquo;s not &ldquo;sort of near&rdquo; the sea&mdash;that&rsquo;s<em>grab your towel and flip-flops, and you&rsquo;re there before your sunscreen dries</em>close.</p><h2>The Scandi-Turkish Style &ndash; Minimalist Meets Mediterranean Comfort</h2><p>So what exactly is Scandi-Turkish? Imagine the clean, functional, light-filled interiors of Scandinavian design, but swap the icy silence for Turkish warmth. It&rsquo;s minimalism that actually smiles at you when you walk in the door.</p><p>Here, the minimalist bones&mdash;open spaces, uncluttered furniture, neutral walls&mdash;are paired with warm wood accents, textured fabrics, and lighting that says<em>stay a while</em>. You can almost feel both Stockholm and Antalya nodding in approval.</p><h2>A Walk Through Your New Home</h2><h3>The Open-Plan Living Area</h3><p>The moment you step inside, you&rsquo;re greeted by a bright, airy space where the living room and kitchen merge into one open-plan design. This layout isn&rsquo;t just about looking modern&mdash;it&rsquo;s about living modern. Want to cook dinner while catching up on your favorite show? Or pour a glass of wine without missing a single story your friend is telling? This setup has you covered.</p><p>Moreover, the open design allows natural light to flow freely, making the whole place feel bigger than it already is (and at 70 m&sup2;, it&rsquo;s already got the upper hand on most).</p><h3>Color and Light &ndash; A Thoughtful Palette</h3><p>The walls and ceilings are dressed in soft beige tones, giving the home a calm, fresh vibe. Meanwhile, glossy cream ceramic tiles bounce light around the room, turning even a cloudy day into a bright one indoors.</p><p>Layered lighting takes things a step further: LED strip lights hidden in the ceiling create a cozy glow for evenings, while spotlights keep your kitchen work area perfectly lit. Therefore, whether you want soft mood lighting for a romantic dinner or a bright setup for an early breakfast, the control is literally at your fingertips.</p><h3>The Kitchen &ndash; Clean Lines and Clever Touches</h3><p>The kitchen is proof that functional can be beautiful. High-gloss white cabinets and a light-toned countertop keep things bright and modern, while a mosaic-effect backsplash adds just the right touch of personality. In addition, integrated white goods mean there&rsquo;s no visual clutter&mdash;everything is streamlined.</p><h3>The Dining Space &ndash; Contrast Done Right</h3><p>Between the kitchen and living room sits a glossy white dining table paired with four black chairs. This pop of contrast keeps the space interesting without overcomplicating the look.</p><p>Consequently, the dining area feels like its own zone without needing walls to define it&mdash;smart use of space in every sense.</p><h3>The Living Room &ndash; Where You&rsquo;ll Actually Want to Sit</h3><p>Anchored by a warm-toned brown sofa, the living area feels like a place you want to curl up with a book, binge a series, or host friends for coffee. It&rsquo;s the kind of seating that says,<em>Yes, stay for another cup</em>.</p><h2>A Bedroom That Balances Calm and Character</h2><p>In the bedroom, the calming beige palette continues, but colorful LED ceiling lights give you the option to switch things up when the mood strikes. The bed frame, bedside tables, and dresser all share the same warm wood finish, tying the whole look together.</p><p>An oversized mirrored wardrobe isn&rsquo;t just practical&mdash;it reflects light and makes the room feel larger. And because it&rsquo;s a Scandi-Turkish space, practicality never comes at the expense of style.</p><h2>The Glass Balcony &ndash; Four Seasons, One Space</h2><p>Some balconies are for summer. This one&rsquo;s for life. Enclosed with glass, it&rsquo;s a breakfast nook in spring, an afternoon tea spot in autumn, and a cozy winter reading corner when you want to feel connected to the outdoors without braving the chill.</p><p>Plus, with the beach practically at your doorstep, you can step outside for sea air any time you like.</p><h2>Who&rsquo;s Going to Love This Apartment?</h2><h3>European and Scandinavian Buyers</h3><p>Minimalism that&rsquo;s warm and welcoming? Check. Bright interiors and open layouts? Double check. If you love the &ldquo;less is more&rdquo; philosophy but want to keep a little &ldquo;more&rdquo; in the comfort department, this home delivers.</p><h3>Young Couples and Small Families</h3><p>That extra space turns a compact 2-room into something you can actually grow into. A real dining area, a living room you can move in, and a bedroom that doesn&rsquo;t feel like a storage unit with a bed&mdash;this is an upgrade you&rsquo;ll notice every day.</p><h3>Remote Workers and Digital Nomads</h3><p>Oba&rsquo;s quiet yet central location makes it perfect for working from home. In addition, you can literally replace your coffee break with a swim or a beach walk.</p><h2>The Location &ndash; Why Oba is the Perfect Balance</h2><p>Oba is one of Alanya&rsquo;s most desirable districts because it blends modern living with local charm. You&rsquo;ve got the long sandy beach for swimming, sunbathing, or water sports. You&rsquo;ve got weekly fresh markets that feel like a slice of the Grand Bazaar.</p><p>In addition, everything is walkable&mdash;shops, cafes, restaurants, pharmacies, and even Alanya Training and Research Hospital. Frequent buses connect you to the city center in minutes, but honestly, you may find you rarely need to leave.</p><p>Cycling paths, tennis courts, and seaside promenades add to the lifestyle. Meanwhile, the neighborhood keeps a calm, residential vibe even during the summer season.</p><h2>Complex Amenities &ndash; Everything You Need, Right at Home</h2><ul><li><p>Swimming pool for summer refreshment</p></li><li><p>Fitness center for staying active year-round</p></li><li><p>Elevator for easy access</p></li><li><p>Well-maintained common areas for a pleasant environment</p></li></ul><p>These aren&rsquo;t just nice extras&mdash;they&rsquo;re part of what makes living here feel like a low-maintenance holiday every day.</p><h2>Thinking Like an Investor? Here&rsquo;s Why This Works</h2><p>Oba has seen steady property value growth thanks to its location, amenities, and popularity among both local and foreign buyers. A fully furnished apartment just 300 meters from the beach is a strong contender in both short-term holiday and long-term rental markets.</p><p>Moreover, the extra size compared to most 2-rooms gives you a marketing edge. Bigger always photographs better.</p><h2>Why Work With Us &ndash; The Luxury Estate Turkey Difference</h2><p>Buying property in Turkey isn&rsquo;t just about choosing a home&mdash;it&rsquo;s about choosing the right partner for the process.

The area offers a slower pace of life while still providing easy access to the city and surrounding regions.</p><p>The beach here is always clean, with crystal-clear waters that are perfect for swimming. In certain areas, the rich marine life makes it an excellent spot for snorkeling and diving. Along the shoreline, you will find charming fish restaurants where you can enjoy freshly caught seafood with a sea breeze.</p><p>Kargıcak is also surrounded by agricultural land, giving the area a natural and unspoiled character. Yet, it has been developing steadily, with more residential complexes, local businesses, and services opening in recent years.</p><h2>Everyday Convenience</h2><p>While Kargıcak is more tranquil than central Alanya, it still has everything you need for daily living. Small shops cover essential needs, while larger supermarkets, banks, and shopping options are just a short trip away in Mahmutlar or Alanya city center. Public transportation is frequent and convenient&mdash;buses 1, 2, and 3 run through Kargıcak and connect to Alanya in about 20 minutes. Taxis are also readily available.</p><p>For dining, Kargıcak offers a mix of local Turkish cuisine and a few European-style restaurants near the hotels. Cafes are mostly family-owned, serving quality home-style meals. Many of the best fish restaurants are located close to the beach.</p><h2>Activities and Lifestyle</h2><p>Kargıcak is perfect for outdoor enthusiasts. Popular activities include nature walks, cycling, swimming, and horseback riding in the surrounding countryside. If you want more variety, Mahmutlar and Alanya offer additional entertainment, shopping, and nightlife.</p><p>The area is also close to natural attractions such as the Dim River (Dim&ccedil;ayı) and Dim Cave&mdash;both ideal for day trips. From many points in Kargıcak, you can enjoy spectacular views of Alanya Castle, the Taurus Mountains, and the Mediterranean Sea.</p><h2>Investment Potential</h2><p>This property&rsquo;s location&mdash;just 100 meters from the beach&mdash;along with its sea view, modern complex facilities, and high rental potential, make it a smart choice for investors. Apartments in Kargıcak are increasingly in demand among both local and international buyers. This unfurnished 2 room layout allows buyers to furnish it according to the tastes of the rental market or for personal use, further increasing its appeal.</p><h2>Work with Luxury Estate Turkey for a Secure Purchase</h2><p>When purchasing property in Alanya, working with an experienced and trustworthy partner ensures a smooth process.

Situated between the sandy Mediterranean shoreline and the scenic Taurus Mountains, the district offers a unique mix of sea and nature. Located just 10 km from Alanya city center, Mahmutlar combines easy access to the city with the calmness of a self-sufficient town.</p><p>The district has grown into a cosmopolitan community, with a large number of foreign residents. Expat families, retirees, and digital nomads find Mahmutlar attractive thanks to its infrastructure, shopping options, and welcoming social environment. Weekly local markets like the Tuesday bazaar offer fresh produce and textiles, while modern shopping centers such as YektaMall and Akdeniz Park serve larger retail needs.</p><p>Transportation is simple: local buses run every 10 minutes to Alanya, and taxis are always available. Within Mahmutlar, minibuses connect different parts of the district, while its flat layout makes walking and cycling easy. Residents enjoy long coastal promenades, green parks, and easy access to nearby districts like Kargıcak and Kestel.</p><p>Furthermore, Mahmutlar provides countless leisure opportunities: water sports on the beach, mountain hikes in the Taurus foothills, and a wide selection of caf&eacute;s, gyms, hamams, and restaurants. It is a district where daily life is both practical and enjoyable.</p><h2>Albimo Loft Residence &ndash; Modern Living on a Grand Scale</h2><p>Albimo Loft Residence, built in 2022, is designed as a contemporary residential complex on a 7,700 m&sup2; land plot. Its architectural design emphasizes open balconies, glass facades, and landscaped green areas, providing residents with a sense of openness and comfort.</p><p>The complex includes one of the most comprehensive ranges of social facilities in Mahmutlar:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Large Outdoor Pool:</strong>Perfect for summer relaxation and family fun.</p></li><li><p><strong>Separate Pool with Waterpark:</strong>Featuring slides, ideal for children and active entertainment.</p></li><li><p><strong>Heated Indoor Pool &amp; Jacuzzi:</strong>Usable all year round, even in cooler months.</p></li><li><p><strong>Spa &amp; Wellness Zone:</strong>Complete with Turkish bath, Finnish sauna, and massage rooms.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness Center:</strong>Fully equipped for both cardio and strength training.</p></li><li><p><strong>Sports Courts:</strong>Basketball and tennis courts provide space for active lifestyles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Facilities:</strong>Outdoor playground, modern indoor playroom, and dedicated children&rsquo;s pool.</p></li><li><p><strong>Entertainment Areas:</strong>Cinema, PlayStation and gaming rooms, billiards, table tennis, and a caf&eacute; for social gatherings.</p></li><li><p><strong>Green and Social Spaces:</strong>Landscaped gardens, barbecue areas, and communal zones for events.</p></li><li><p><strong>Practical Amenities:</strong>Wi-Fi across the complex, parking options (both open and garage), 24/7 security with camera system, and a generator for uninterrupted comfort.</p></li></ul><p>Therefore, Albimo Loft functions not only as a residence but as a complete lifestyle complex.</p><h2>Apartment Layout &ndash; Bright, Functional, and Stylish</h2><p>This<strong>3 room apartment in Mahmutlar</strong>offers 64 m&sup2; of thoughtfully planned living space, oriented towards the south to maximize natural light. The apartment consists of one bedroom, a combined living room and open kitchen, and a spacious balcony.</p><h3>Living Room &amp; Kitchen</h3><p>The integrated living room and open kitchen create a practical and modern environment. White lacquered cabinets contrast with a black-detailed countertop, providing a clean, stylish, and contemporary look. The choice of materials enhances brightness, while light-colored ceramic floors reflect natural light, making the space feel larger than its size.</p><p>The seating area features neutral beige and gray tones, giving the room a calm and relaxing atmosphere. With the addition of a large rug, artwork, or decorative plants, the space can easily feel warmer and more personalized.</p><h3>Bedroom</h3><p>The bedroom maintains a minimalist style with white furniture. A mirrored sliding wardrobe adds functionality while visually expanding the space. Simple curtains fit the modern line, while the bedframe and linens can be personalized for warmth. With soft lighting, textiles, and wooden accents, the bedroom can transform into a cozy retreat.</p><h3>Balcony</h3><p>One of the strongest features of the apartment is its large balcony. With open views and generous space, it can serve as a second living area. With the installation of a folding glass system, the balcony can be used year-round as a winter garden. Furnished with lounge seating, a dining set, and greenery, it becomes the heart of the home.</p><h3>Lighting and Details</h3><p>The apartment is equipped with recessed spotlights throughout, creating a sleek and modern feel. However, adding a statement chandelier in the living room or soft bedside lamps in the bedroom can provide warmer ambiance. Decorative details&mdash;such as wall art, plants, and textiles&mdash;can transform the apartment from minimalist to inviting without losing its modern elegance.</p><h2>General Interior Impression</h2><p>From an interior design perspective, the apartment already offers a strong foundation: modern lines, a clean black-and-white contrast, and functional storage. However, because of its minimalist approach, it may feel slightly cold. Adding wooden textures, textiles, and personal accessories will make the space warmer and more welcoming.</p><p>As it stands, the apartment is highly attractive for investors. Its modern and neutral base allows tenants to easily adapt it to their tastes, making it easy to rent out quickly. For personal use, small design updates will make it both stylish and homely.</p><h2>Location Advantages &ndash; South-Facing Comfort in Mahmutlar</h2><p>This apartment benefits from a south-facing orientation, ensuring plenty of daylight and warmth throughout the year. Located just 700 meters from the sea, it allows residents to enjoy beach life daily while also staying close to shops, schools, and restaurants.</p><p>Nearby, you&rsquo;ll find family-run caf&eacute;s, international chains, fitness studios, and essential shops. Bus stops and taxi points are within easy reach, making travel to Alanya city center convenient.</p><h2>Investment Potential &ndash; Strong Appeal for Buyers and Renters</h2><p>The<strong>3 room apartment in Albimo Loft Mahmutlar</strong>stands out as a smart investment:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Rental Demand:</strong>Compact, modern apartments near the sea remain among the most requested properties for both holiday rentals and long-term tenants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Resale Value:</strong>Built in 2022, the residence retains a high market value thanks to its modern facilities and location.</p></li><li><p><strong>Year-Round Appeal:</strong>The south-facing layout and comprehensive social facilities make the property suitable for both summer holidays and permanent living.</p></li><li><p><strong>Citizenship &amp; Residence Permit:</strong>Depending on purchase price and legal framework, the property may contribute to Turkish residence or citizenship opportunities.</p></li></ol><p>Therefore, whether your goal is steady rental income, long-term appreciation, or a ready-to-move holiday home, this apartment delivers excellent potential.</p><h2>Who Will Benefit Most from This Apartment?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Young Professionals &amp; Couples:</strong>A stylish, compact base with modern facilities.</p></li><li><p><strong>Small Families:</strong>Safe environment with children&rsquo;s pools, playgrounds, and indoor play areas.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors:</strong>A low-maintenance apartment with high rental demand.</p></li><li><p><strong>Holiday Home Seekers:</strong>Close to the beach and equipped with year-round leisure options.</p></li></ul><h2>Why Partner with Luxury Estate Turkey?</h2><p>Choosing the right real estate partner in Turkey makes all the difference in buying abroad.

The building itself is well-kept, which is always reassuring when you're making an investment like this.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">For international buyers, this property has an added advantage: it meets the requirements for<strong>Turkish citizenship by investment</strong>. You can access our comprehensive question-and-answer article on Turkish citizenship:<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/blog/turkish-citizenship-by-investment-frequently-asked-questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here!</a>That's become increasingly important for foreign investors looking at the Alanya market, and properties that qualify are definitely worth considering if that's something on your radar.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Overall, it's one of those listings that ticks multiple boxes &ndash; comfortable living space, move-in ready condition, and strategic value for investment purposes. Mahmutlar has been growing in popularity, and properties like this one show you why.</p><h2>Interior Atmosphere &ndash; Warmth Meets Practical Modernity</h2><p>Step into the apartment and the first impression is a feeling of warmth balanced with modern practicality. The living area benefits from wide floor tiles in light tones and clean white kitchen cabinetry. These elements amplify the natural light streaming through large windows.</p><p>A coral-red sectional sofa takes center stage in the living room, instantly bringing energy and character to the space. The choice of this bold color creates a focal point while still blending harmoniously with the neutral palette. The overall result is a lively yet inviting living zone.</p><h3>Living Room and Kitchen Connection</h3><p>The kitchen corner adopts a crisp modern look with glossy white cabinets and a backsplash of small mosaic tiles. A sleek black countertop adds sharp contrast, ensuring balance in the design. This setting not only looks stylish but also functions well for everyday cooking and dining.</p><p>The living area is organized around a single focal zone: the sofa, a central coffee table, and a streamlined TV unit. Grey brick-effect wallpaper on one wall contributes an urban loft touch, complemented by modern lighting fixtures that distribute light evenly throughout the space.</p><p>Wall decoration with framed artworks and a large statement piece prevents the space from appearing bare, giving a sense of completeness and homeliness.</p><h3>Bedroom &ndash; Calm and Restorative</h3><p>The bedroom continues the theme of simplicity and brightness. A cream-colored bedspread and white furniture encourage serenity and relaxation. Spotlights in the ceiling and a geometric patterned rug break the uniformity, offering subtle rhythm to the room.</p><p>A wardrobe with black accent details introduces a touch of classic character without overpowering the minimalist design. The overall feeling is one of calm &mdash; ideal for restorative sleep.</p><h3>Entrance Hall &ndash; Warm First Impressions</h3><p>The entrance features a long patterned runner rug that guides visitors inside, immediately setting a welcoming mood. Family photographs on the wall reinforce the sense of a real home, not just a property. They show how easily this apartment can be personalized to reflect the new owner&rsquo;s life and memories.</p><h3>Decorative Identity</h3><p>In terms of overall decoration, the apartment blends modern and functional lines with intimate details. Neutrals such as white, cream, and grey form the background, while coral red acts as a confident accent. This careful balance avoids monotony and creates a space where one can truly feel both comfort and individuality.</p><h2>Residence Facilities &ndash; Everyday Comfort Secured</h2><p>The complex provides everything necessary for a safe and comfortable lifestyle.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Swimming Pool</strong>&ndash; perfect for summer days and family leisure.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fitness Center</strong>&ndash; residents can maintain an active lifestyle year-round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Children&rsquo;s Pool</strong>&ndash; safe fun for younger residents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Green Spaces &amp; Barbecue Area</strong>&ndash; communal spots encourage relaxation and social interaction.</p></li><li><p><strong>Generator</strong>&ndash; uninterrupted electricity for peace of mind.</p></li><li><p><strong>24/7 Camera &amp; Door Security</strong>&ndash; constant safety for all residents.</p></li><li><p><strong>Caretaker Services</strong>&ndash; daily upkeep that keeps the property tidy and functional.</p></li><li><p><strong>Disabled-Friendly Design</strong>&ndash; accessible for residents and guests of all abilities.</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, proximity to the bus stop and the beach ensures that daily mobility is smooth and convenient.</p><h3>South Orientation &ndash; Brightness and Energy Efficiency</h3><p>The south-facing orientation deserves special mention. It brings abundant natural light throughout the day, making interiors brighter and more cheerful. Consequently, heating costs reduce in winter and the overall energy efficiency of the home improves. This factor is highly valued in Mediterranean properties, both for lifestyle comfort and for long-term sustainability.</p><h2>Mahmutlar &ndash; A Neighborhood of International Appeal</h2><p>Mahmutlar, positioned about 10 km from Alanya city center, represents one of the most cosmopolitan districts of the region. With a strong expatriate community, international residents find it easy to adapt. The district stretches between the Mediterranean shoreline and the slopes of the Taurus Mountains, offering a unique blend of sea air and green landscapes.</p><p>Daily life here is practical and self-sufficient. Butchers, bakeries, hardware stores, and small family-owned shops are spread throughout the district. Larger malls like<strong>YektaMall</strong>and<strong>Akdeniz Park</strong>provide modern shopping alternatives. On Tuesdays, a lively street market fills the town with fresh produce, textiles, and local specialties.</p><p>Transport is straightforward: local minibuses circulate frequently within Mahmutlar and towards neighboring Kargıcak, while buses to Alanya run every 10 minutes. Taxis are available on every corner, and cycling remains a popular way to move around thanks to flat coastal roads.</p><p>Mahmutlar&rsquo;s coastline is lively with beach clubs, water sports, and fishing opportunities, while the backdrop of the mountains offers routes for hiking and picnics. This duality &mdash; active beach life combined with serene mountain escapes &mdash; is one of the reasons many families and retirees prefer Mahmutlar.</p><h2>Lifestyle Options &ndash; Families, Digital Nomads, or Investors</h2><p>This apartment adapts to different lifestyles with ease.</p><ul><li><p><strong>For Families</strong>: The spacious layout provides comfort, and the complex&rsquo;s facilities create a safe environment for children. Schools, parks, and healthcare services are nearby, supporting long-term living.</p></li><li><p><strong>For Digital Nomads</strong>: Fast connections, caf&eacute;s with reliable Wi-Fi, and a community of international residents create an ideal working base in the Mediterranean.</p></li><li><p><strong>For Investors</strong>: Mahmutlar maintains high rental demand, both short and long-term, ensuring attractive yields. The citizenship eligibility further enhances the property&rsquo;s value, turning it into not only a home but also a financial instrument.</p></li></ul><h2>Investment Perspective &ndash; Citizenship and Beyond</h2><p>One of the strongest selling points is the eligibility for<strong>Turkish citizenship by investment</strong>. Buyers meeting the official investment threshold can obtain citizenship through this property, securing rights such as visa-free travel to numerous countries, full residence in Turkey, and long-term investment protection.</p><p>Moreover, Mahmutlar&rsquo;s continuous growth means that property values remain on a steady upward trajectory.

With its clean white walls, neutral-toned floors, and modern structure, it waits like a blank canvas for its new owner to add color, warmth, and personality.</p><p>At 55 m&sup2;, the apartment may be compact, but the design makes smart use of every corner. Large windows invite plenty of daylight, instantly making the rooms feel bigger and brighter.

For those who prefer to start with a fresh base and shape it according to their own taste, this apartment could not be more perfect.</p><h2>Interior Features &ndash; Fresh, Clean, and Flexible</h2><p>Step inside, and the first thing you notice is how bright it feels. The polished ceramic floors reflect natural light, enhancing the sense of openness. The kitchen is integrated into the living room, creating a functional central space that works for both daily meals and social gatherings.</p><p>With no furniture included, the apartment avoids forcing any particular style on you. This is a home that says,<em>&ldquo;make me what you want me to be.&rdquo;</em>Whether you imagine sleek modern lines, warm wooden textures, or bold colors, the neutral background will adapt easily.</p><p>The balcony is another highlight. Even though the apartment itself is compact, the balcony adds valuable outdoor living space. In Alanya, balconies are often treated like a second living room&mdash;ideal for morning coffee, evening conversations, or even working with your laptop while enjoying the city view.</p><h2>The Novis Parador Lifestyle &ndash; More Than Just a Building</h2><p>What sets this property apart is not only the apartment itself but the facilities of<strong>Novis Parador Residence</strong>.

    "property_title": "Cozy Alanya Center Apartment in City Corner Residence",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>2 Room Apartment for Sale in City Corner Residence Alanya Center &ndash; Compact Comfort in the Heart of the City</h2><p>Not every apartment needs to be large to feel welcoming. This<strong>2 room apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>shows how thoughtful decoration and modern design can turn 60 m&sup2; into a stylish and comfortable living space. Located inside<strong>City Corner Residence</strong>, right in the center of Alanya, the apartment combines the convenience of urban living with a calm, cozy atmosphere.</p><p>The first impression is brightness. White and beige tones on the walls and furnishings reflect natural light from the large windows, making the interior feel airy and inviting. Despite being in the middle of a busy city, the home has a peaceful vibe&mdash;proof that clever design can create balance even in compact spaces.</p><p>The balcony adds another dimension, offering views of Alanya&rsquo;s urban landscape framed by the distant Taurus Mountains. It&rsquo;s a spot where city life and natural beauty meet in one frame, making mornings and evenings equally enjoyable.</p><h2>Interior Features &ndash; Modern, Functional, and Light-Filled</h2><h3>Living Room</h3><p>The living room is decorated with simplicity in mind. A light grey sofa, a small pouf, and a round wooden table with cream-colored chairs create a seating arrangement that works without overwhelming the limited floor space. For a 60 m&sup2; home, the choice of minimal furniture makes all the difference&mdash;it keeps the room uncluttered and easy to move around in.</p><p>Accessories also play a role. A rattan shelf unit adds texture and warmth, breaking up the otherwise sleek surfaces. On the wall, a simple leaf-themed decoration provides a touch of personality without demanding attention. The flooring, polished marble-look tiles, reinforces the sense of space while staying true to modern taste. Overall, the style is a light mix of<strong>boho and Scandinavian</strong>, blending functionality with natural details.</p><h3>Kitchen</h3><p>Connected to the living room, the open-plan kitchen is compact but efficient.<strong>White lacquer cabinets</strong>paired with a<strong>black countertop</strong>create a crisp contrast, making the area feel both modern and timeless. Built-in appliances and a washing machine are neatly integrated, leaving nothing out of place.</p><p>While not large, the kitchen is perfectly sufficient for everyday cooking. The contrast of white and black feels modern, while the glossy finishes keep the space bright. For buyers who value practicality in a central home, this kitchen ticks all the boxes.</p><h3>Bedroom</h3><p>The bedroom continues the calm and functional theme. Positioned opposite large windows, the bed receives plenty of natural light, creating a fresh morning atmosphere. The grey-toned headboard and base are kept simple, while the powder-pink bedding softens the overall look.</p><p>A white wardrobe provides both storage and brightness, ensuring the room doesn&rsquo;t feel cramped. Beside the bed, rattan lamps and small wooden tables echo the natural details seen in the living room. This consistency gives the apartment a sense of design unity, small but carefully put together.</p><h3>Balcony and Views</h3><p>The balcony looks out onto the city, with the Alanya sign and Taurus Mountains visible in the distance. While the immediate view includes neighboring buildings, the broader scene blends urban life with the backdrop of nature. Many residents decorate balconies with plants, effectively creating a small garden in the sky. Even with limited square meters, it becomes a valuable extension of the living area&mdash;perfect for coffee, reading, or casual dinners.</p><h2>Residence Features &ndash; Comfort and Convenience</h2><p>City Corner Residence is designed for those who want both comfort and practicality. Facilities include:</p><ul><li><p>Swimming pool</p></li><li><p>24/7 camera security</p></li><li><p>Caretaker services</p></li><li><p>Generator for uninterrupted electricity</p></li><li><p>Barbecue area</p></li><li><p>Children&rsquo;s pool and playground</p></li><li><p>Disabled-friendly access</p></li><li><p>Open car park</p></li><li><p>Satellite TV and internet infrastructure</p></li></ul><p>These features make everyday living smooth and worry-free. For families, children have safe spaces to play. For professionals, security and caretaker services mean less to worry about. For everyone, the pool and communal areas provide leisure without leaving the residence.</p><h2>Who Is This Apartment For?</h2><p>Different buyers will find their own reasons to love this property:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Students and young professionals</strong>: With compact size, modern furnishings, and a central location, it works perfectly for single living or a couple starting out.</p></li><li><p><strong>Young couples</strong>: Affordable, stylish, and close to the city&rsquo;s social life, this is an easy first step into homeownership.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>: A<strong>furnished 2 room apartment in Alanya center</strong>is always in demand for rental. Short-term holiday rentals, long-term tenants, and even digital nomads all seek this type of property.</p></li><li><p><strong>City lifestyle lovers</strong>: For those who want to walk everywhere&mdash;caf&eacute;s, shops, restaurants, and beaches&mdash;this address is ideal.</p></li></ul><h2>Living in Alanya Center</h2><p>Living in the heart of Alanya comes with endless advantages. Streets are filled with trendy caf&eacute;s, boutique stores, jewelry shops, and global fashion brands. Restaurants serve both local and international cuisine, while smaller backstreet caf&eacute;s provide affordable everyday meals.</p><p>Historic sites like the<strong>Red Tower (Kızıl Kule)</strong>,<strong>Alanya Castle</strong>, and the ancient shipyard are all close, blending daily life with cultural heritage. For leisure,<strong>Damlataş Beach</strong>and the<strong>Cable Car</strong>are within walking distance. Shopping options range from local markets to high-street fashion and electronics.</p><p>Public transport is easy to use. The 101 bus runs along the coastal route, connecting all major beaches. The 202 lines reach Oba, Tosmur, and other districts. Taxis are readily available at all hours. Essentially, living here means you are never more than a few minutes away from what you need.</p><p>Alanya center is vibrant, sometimes busy, but always alive. It is a place where you can shop, dine, swim, and enjoy history all in the same day. For buyers who want to be at the core of city life, this location is unbeatable.</p><h2>Investment Potential</h2><p>Compact, fully furnished apartments in Alanya center are always high in demand. With a size of 60 m&sup2; and a city-view balcony, this property is easy to rent out. Tourists look for short-term rentals close to the beach, while professionals and students prefer long-term leases near the center. Both markets ensure consistent income potential.</p><p>The fact that the apartment is in a central, established residence also supports value appreciation. As Alanya continues to grow in popularity, properties in the heart of the city hold their value and often rise faster than in outlying districts.</p><h2>Trusted Advisors, Transparent Service, and Ongoing Commitment</h2><p>At Luxury Estate Turkey, we understand that buying property abroad requires more than just an attractive apartment.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>3 Room Apartment for Sale in Alanya &ndash; 250 m to Beach</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">If you're searching for an<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/near-kleopatra-beach\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>near Cleopatra Beach</a>that perfectly balances urban energy with seamless beach access, this home within<strong>VESTA CLEOPATRA Residence</strong>delivers exactly that experience. Located on an<strong>active street</strong>with a welcoming rhythm, you'll find nearby markets that effortlessly handle your daily shopping needs, while local restaurants hosting<strong>live music and karaoke nights</strong>create spontaneous evening entertainment without requiring elaborate planning.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The true highlight lies in<strong>Cleopatra Beach sitting just 250 meters away</strong>. This proximity means you can genuinely sync your daily rhythm with the sea's tempo. Start your morning with coffee on the balcony, then stroll down for a quick swim before work. Take lunch breaks by the water to refresh, or catch the sunset on the sand after a productive day. The flexibility to match your pace to the sea happens in minutes, not hours.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The apartment's layout prioritizes both<strong>practicality and flexibility</strong>:<strong>2 bedrooms + 1 living room with open kitchen</strong>are intelligently organized across<strong>70 m&sup2;</strong>. Since the space comes<strong>furnished with white goods</strong>, your moving process accelerates significantly while coordination headaches disappear. You can literally arrive with your suitcases and settle in the same day.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">The<strong>balcony</strong>serves as this apartment's genuine value addition.<strong>City, mountain, and facilities views</strong>transform quick coffee breaks into peaceful breathing moments, while long dinner preparations become effortless evening rituals. Watch the Taurus Mountains' silhouette during morning hours, observe the city's daily pulse in the afternoon, and enjoy the pool area's gentle activity as evening approaches.</p><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Ultimately, this 3 room apartment for sale in Alanya accommodates both practical daily living and spontaneous weekend adventures without requiring any compromises. Every aspect works together to support the lifestyle you actually want to live.</p><h2>Furnished 3 Room Apartment for Sale in Alanya &mdash; Interior Overview</h2><p>Step inside and the<strong>bright, minimalist</strong>aesthetic sets a calm tone.<strong>White and light-toned walls</strong>reflect daylight, while<strong>glossy ceramic floors</strong>amplify it. Therefore, rooms feel open and tidy even before you add personal touches. Because the overall palette stays neutral, your own furniture accents&mdash;textiles, art, lighting&mdash;integrate smoothly without clashing.</p><h3>Living Room &amp; American Kitchen: Social by Design</h3><p>The<strong>open-plan living room and American kitchen</strong>encourage connection. You cook, talk, and host within one continuous space, which suits both daily routines and informal gatherings. In addition, the kitchen&rsquo;s<strong>sleek white cabinetry</strong>and<strong>clean lines</strong>make prep surfaces feel generous. The<strong>contrasting black-and-white backsplash</strong>adds a modern edge, and maintenance stays straightforward thanks to durable finishes.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Functional seating</strong>: a comfortable L-shaped sofa zones the living area without closing it off.</p></li><li><p><strong>Minimalist TV unit &amp; coffee table</strong>: simple forms that keep the room efficient.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dining corner</strong>: a<strong>white table</strong>with<strong>black-white chairs</strong>creates a crisp visual rhythm; you slide from breakfast to late-night tea without rearranging the space.</p></li></ul><p>Consequently, everyday life flows: quick breakfasts before the beach, shared cooking on weeknights, and easy movie evenings when you want to stay in.</p><h3>Bedrooms: Calm, Organized, and Practical</h3><p>You gain<strong>two bedrooms</strong>that continue the clean look.<strong>White walls</strong>and<strong>glossy floors</strong>keep light moving, while<strong>mirrored wardrobes</strong>expand the feel of each room and boost storage without visual clutter. One bedroom centers around a<strong>double bed</strong>; the other includes a<strong>single bed</strong>&mdash;both with modern headboards that add structure without heaviness. Textiles soften the geometry, and<strong>wall art</strong>introduces a subtle personal note.</p><p>Therefore, you start with restful spaces that already work. In addition, the neutral base invites gradual personalization: a rug for warmth, a pendant for glow, and a side chair for reading quickly complete the setup.</p><h3>Balcony with City, Mountain, and Facilities Views</h3><p>The<strong>balcony</strong>transforms into a cherished daily ritual space, whether you step outside for a rejuvenating five-minute reset or settle in for extended dinner moments as evening temperatures cool.</p><p>The diverse outlook combining<strong>city</strong>,<strong>mountain</strong>, and<strong>facilities</strong>views ensures the scenery evolves naturally throughout the day: brilliant morning brightness illuminating the Taurus Mountains, comfortable late-afternoon shade perfect for phone calls or reading, and enchanting nighttime lights creating a gentle glow across the residential complex.</p><p>A compact dining set can transform this outdoor space into a genuine extension of your living area&mdash;perfect for sunrise coffee rituals, peaceful midday phone conversations, or simple post-beach meals under the stars.</p><h3>Everyday Details That Make Life Easier</h3><ul><li><p><strong>White goods included</strong>: you avoid the time and cost of sourcing appliances.</p></li><li><p><strong>Electric water heater</strong>: hot water stays predictable year-round.</p></li><li><p><strong>Furnished</strong>: essential pieces let you live comfortably from day one; add only what you want, when you want.</p></li></ul><p>Because the apartment already covers the basics, you can focus on establishing your routine rather than managing logistics. Consequently, move-in feels more like arriving than starting a project.</p><h2>Location &mdash; VESTA CLEOPATRA Residence, 250 m to Cleopatra Beach</h2><p>The setting matters. Here,<strong>Cleopatra Beach</strong>sits<strong>approximately 250 meters</strong>from your door. You walk down with a towel over your shoulder; no parking, no schedule. Meanwhile, the street below stays<strong>active</strong>in the best way: familiar faces, steady foot traffic, and the comfort of knowing that a quick errand or a last-minute dinner always remains an option.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Markets nearby</strong>: daily groceries, household items, and fresh basics stay within short walking distance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Local restaurants</strong>: evenings bring<strong>live music</strong>and<strong>karaoke nights</strong>, so you get social energy without leaving the neighborhood.</p></li><li><p><strong>Walkable rhythm</strong>: most needs sit within a few blocks, which reduces dependency on a car.</p></li></ul><p>In addition, the wider surroundings connect naturally to the rest of Alanya. Therefore, you can keep plans spontaneous&mdash;coffee by the beach, a swim, a bite at a local spot&mdash;or reach the center efficiently when you want more options.</p><h2>Building &amp; Complex Features</h2><p>VESTA CLEOPATRA Residence supports daily life with amenities that extend your living space:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Pool</strong>and<strong>children&rsquo;s pool</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Children&rsquo;s park</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Sauna</strong>and<strong>fitness</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Barbecue</strong>area for easy weekend gatherings</p></li><li><p><strong>Generator</strong>for power continuity</p></li><li><p><strong>Cable TV / satellite</strong>infrastructure</p></li><li><p><strong>24/7 camera</strong>coverage and<strong>caretaker</strong>for order and peace of mind</p></li><li><p><strong>Near bus stop</strong>,<strong>close to beach</strong></p></li></ul><p>Moreover, the<strong>area is open for residence permit</strong>, which adds practical value for long stays or future planning. Consequently, this<strong>3 room apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>pairs walkable city comfort with managed-residence convenience.</p><h2>Lifestyle: City Energy by Day, Beach Routine by Choice</h2><p>Because you live near markets and restaurants, errands fold naturally into your walks. You return home with what you need, not a trunk full of extras. Meanwhile,<strong>live music</strong>and<strong>karaoke</strong>bring friendly noise to the evenings. If you prefer quiet nights, you keep them; if you want to join the neighborhood&rsquo;s small celebrations, you step out and participate. In addition, the beach invites you at any hour&mdash;morning swims, mid-day sun, or sunset walks.</p><p>For instance, a typical day might look like this:</p><ol><li><p>A quick breakfast at home</p></li><li><p>A swim at<strong>Cleopatra Beach</strong></p></li><li><p>Groceries from a<strong>nearby market</strong>on the return walk</p></li><li><p>Work or rest in the cool of the apartment</p></li><li><p>A short gym session in the<strong>fitness</strong>area or a<strong>sauna</strong>break</p></li><li><p>Dinner at a local<strong>restaurant</strong>with live music&mdash;or a simple barbecue with friends at the complex</p></li></ol><p>Therefore, the address doesn&rsquo;t just shorten distances; it compresses the time between intention and action.</p><h2>Investment Perspective &mdash; High Rental Potential Near Cleopatra Beach</h2><p>From an investor&rsquo;s lens, the fundamentals line up:</p><ul><li><p><strong>250 m to Cleopatra Beach</strong>anchors year-round demand.</p></li><li><p><strong>3 room plan (2 bedrooms + living/kitchen)</strong>fits couples, small families, and friends sharing.</p></li><li><p><strong>Furnished with white goods</strong>reduces vacancy time between tenancies.</p></li><li><p><strong>Facilities view + city/mountain outlook</strong>adds listing appeal.</p></li><li><p><strong>Active street</strong>with dining and entertainment options strengthens the &ldquo;walk out and enjoy&rdquo; factor.</p></li><li><p><strong>Complex amenities</strong>(pool, fitness, sauna, kids&rsquo; areas) expand the audience beyond pure beach seekers.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cash payment &mdash; discount offer</strong>can sharpen entry price.</p></li><li><p><strong>Area open for residence permit</strong>attracts medium- to long-term tenants.</p></li></ul><p>Consequently, this<strong>3 room apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>supports both short-stay and long-stay strategies. In addition, the practical 70 m&sup2; footprint keeps running costs predictable while still delivering two bedrooms&mdash;often the sweet spot for occupancy.</p><h2>Who Will Love This Cleopatra Beach Apartment for Sale in Alanya?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Beach-first buyers</strong>who want the sea within a few minutes on foot</p></li><li><p><strong>Small families</strong>and<strong>couples</strong>who value two proper bedrooms in a compact, efficient plan</p></li><li><p><strong>Remote professionals</strong>who want walkable amenities and balanced urban energy</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>targeting dependable demand near a blue-chip beach</p></li><li><p><strong>Second-home owners</strong>who prefer furnished convenience and on-site facilities</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, the neutral interior allows different styles&mdash;minimalist, contemporary, or soft-coastal&mdash;to fit without renovation. Therefore, you adapt the space to your taste rather than adapting your taste to the space.</p><h2>How the Neighborhood Feels Day to Night?</h2><p>During the day, shops and markets keep the sidewalks moving. You recognize staff by name, and errands turn into quick conversations. Meanwhile, afternoons often pull you toward the beach&mdash;250 meters changes how you plan, because a swim becomes a break rather than a trip. In the evening, restaurants warm up; some nights you hear a favorite tune from a<strong>live music</strong>set, and other nights the block laughs along with<strong>karaoke</strong>. Consequently, the area supports quiet routines and social moments in equal measure.</p><p>For those who like balance, the building amenities help. A<strong>sauna</strong>session cuts through the day&rsquo;s pace, and a short<strong>fitness</strong>workout resets your energy. Families appreciate the<strong>children&rsquo;s pool</strong>and<strong>park</strong>; friends appreciate the<strong>barbecue</strong>corner when the weekend arrives. In addition, the<strong>generator</strong>and<strong>24/7 camera</strong>coverage add practical peace of mind to the lifestyle picture.</p><h2>Legal &amp; Practical Guidance &mdash; Residence Permit</h2><p>Because the<strong>area is open for residence permit</strong>, buyers planning longer stays gain a clearer path. Documentation still takes coordination, of course, but eligibility at the neighborhood level removes a major variable. Therefore, if residence planning sits on your list, this<strong>3 room apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>pairs the right location with the right paperwork context.</p><p>We can outline typical steps, expected timelines, and which documents to prepare first. Moreover, if you&rsquo;re comparing different approaches, we&rsquo;ll help you understand which route aligns with your goals and how property ownership fits into the sequence.</p><h2>Collaboration That Simplifies Everything</h2><h3>Work with Luxury Estate Turkey</h3><p>We help you move from interest to keys with calm, organized steps. Our support includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Private or online property tours</strong>tailored to your schedule</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and notary coordination</strong>so documents move in the right order</p></li><li><p><strong>Residence permit guidance</strong>and, when relevant, advice on<strong>citizenship</strong>pathways</p></li><li><p><strong>Rental income consultation</strong>if you plan to lease the apartment</p></li><li><p><strong>Post-sale assistance</strong>to ease your first weeks in the property</p></li><li><p><strong>Trade-in mediation</strong>or<strong>brokerage to sell your current home</strong>while you buy this one</p></li></ul><p>Moreover, we keep communication clear and proactive, so you always know what comes next. Consequently, decisions feel informed rather than rushed.</p><h2>Why This 3 Room Cleopatra Beach Apartment for Sale in Alanya Stands Out?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>250 m to Cleopatra Beach</strong>&mdash;you actually use the sea because it&rsquo;s that close</p></li><li><p><strong>Active street</strong>with markets and local restaurants that host<strong>live music &amp; karaoke</strong></p></li><li><p><strong>Furnished, 70 m&sup2;, 2 bedrooms</strong>&mdash;a practical size that lives bigger than it reads</p></li><li><p><strong>Balcony with city, mountain &amp; facilities views</strong>&mdash;a real extra room for daily life</p></li><li><p><strong>Amenity-rich complex</strong>&mdash;pool, kids&rsquo; areas, sauna, fitness, barbecue, caretaker, generator</p></li><li><p><strong>Area open for residence permit</strong>&mdash;useful for long-term plans</p></li><li><p><strong>High rental potential</strong>+<strong>cash discount</strong>option&mdash;strong fundamentals for investors</p></li></ul><p>Therefore, whether you want a simple beach routine, a compact and efficient home base, or a well-located investment, this address answers cleanly.</p><h2 class=\"text-xl font-bold text-text-100 mt-1 -mb-0.5\">Book Your Visit with Luxury Estate Turkey Today</h2><p class=\"whitespace-normal break-words\">Ready to experience the natural light, thoughtful layout, and vibrant neighborhood energy for yourself?<strong>Book a private viewing</strong>or request a comprehensive<strong>live video tour</strong>that captures every corner and detail.

    "property_title": "Residence Permit Eligible Apartment in Alanya, 70m to the Sea!",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>What if your daily routine began just 70 meters from the beach in Alanya?</h2><p>Not as a holiday, not as a once-in-a-while trip, but as your everyday life. In Alanya&rsquo;s Oba, where long sandy beaches stretch for kilometers and where both locals and international residents create a lively community, this fully furnished property in Alanya offers exactly that possibility. Compact in size but rich in lifestyle benefits, the home combines a renovated interior, unbeatable proximity to the sea, and direct access to Oba&rsquo;s vibrant weekly markets.</p><p>It&rsquo;s more than a home &mdash; it&rsquo;s a lifestyle reset, placing the energy of the Mediterranean right at your doorstep.</p><h2>A Compact Home with Modern Personality</h2><p>At 65 m&sup2;, the apartment might seem modest in scale, but the design choices expand its character. After a thoughtful renovation, every corner has been optimized to reflect both function and style.</p><p><strong>Living Room and Kitchen in Harmony</strong><br />The open-plan kitchen flows directly into the living area, making the space social and easy to navigate. White cabinetry reflects light, while a dark countertop and grey stone-look backsplash create a bold, modern contrast. Ceiling LED strips add a contemporary edge, keeping the atmosphere fresh and youthful.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s the unexpected centerpiece: a vibrant pink L-shaped sofa. This playful choice injects energy into the space, reminding us that city living doesn&rsquo;t need to feel muted. Instead, the apartment embraces color, making it instantly memorable.</p><p><strong>Bedroom Simplicity for Restful Nights</strong><br />The bedroom returns to calmer tones. Neutral walls and straightforward furniture layouts create a flexible, restful environment. A large window ensures plenty of daylight, while curtains add privacy when needed. The lack of built-in furnishings gives future owners freedom to adapt the space as they please.</p><p><strong>Balcony &ndash; A Daily Stage for Life in Oba</strong><br />The round-shaped, covered balcony is generous in size, and it works year-round. In summer, it offers shade and airflow; in winter, it remains usable thanks to its protective covering. Its position near the weekly market means residents can sit outside and observe Oba&rsquo;s lively rhythm below. From morning coffee to evening relaxation, this outdoor extension of the apartment enhances daily life.</p><p><strong>Flooring and Details</strong><br />Glossy grey ceramic tiles cover the apartment, reflecting natural light and making the rooms feel larger. Contrast dominates the design: black-and-white furniture pieces against the pink sofa, neutral walls offset by bold accents. The result is an interior that feels compact yet alive, simple yet confident.</p><h2>Living in a Place That Balances Ease and Energy</h2><p>Oba is one of Alanya&rsquo;s most practical areas, and this apartment&rsquo;s location demonstrates why. Being only 70 meters from the sea means daily swims and seaside walks are part of normal routines. The western-facing orientation adds the bonus of evening sunlight, ideal for sunset moments on the balcony.</p><p>And then there&rsquo;s the market. Oba&rsquo;s famous bazaars, held every Monday and Thursday, are only steps away. Residents can shop for fresh fruits, vegetables, clothing, and even handmade items, all without needing a car. Combined with the variety of nearby supermarkets, cafes, and restaurants, this location keeps life both easy and vibrant.</p><p>Public transport is another strong advantage. Almost all bus lines pass through Oba, making it simple to reach Alanya&rsquo;s city center or neighboring districts like Tosmur, Kestel, and Mahmutlar. For healthcare needs, the Alanya Training and Research Hospital is also in Oba, reinforcing the area&rsquo;s reputation as one of the city&rsquo;s most convenient places to live.</p><h2>Who Will Find This Apartment Ideal?</h2><h3>Young Professionals and Couples</h3><p>The modern renovation, energetic design choices, and compact scale make this apartment particularly appealing to younger buyers. The fact that it is sold fully furnished allows for an immediate move-in without extra expenses. Its central location ensures that nightlife, cafes, and the beach are all within walking distance &mdash; a lifestyle that many professionals and couples value.</p><h3>International Buyers</h3><p>Residence permit eligibility combined with beach proximity makes this home a smart choice for foreign buyers. Whether used as a holiday base or a permanent residence, the property provides the essentials international residents most often seek: security, practicality, and quick access to the sea.</p><h3>Investors</h3><p>For investors, the formula is clear: renovated interiors, central Oba location, and walking distance to both the beach and the market. These factors ensure strong demand for both short-term holiday rentals and long-term leases. The apartment&rsquo;s manageable size keeps maintenance costs low, further increasing profitability.</p><h3>Retirees and Seasonal Residents</h3><p>Not every retiree wants a large home to maintain. For some, simplicity is key. This apartment suits that mindset perfectly: manageable in scale, easy to maintain, yet rich in lifestyle benefits. Being able to walk to the sea or the market makes everyday life stress-free, while the covered balcony creates a calm corner for rest and reflection.</p><h2>Investment Outlook &ndash; More Than a Place to Live</h2><p>Oba has become one of Alanya&rsquo;s most stable areas for real estate appreciation. Its combination of local amenities, international community, and beach access ensures consistent demand. Properties near the market and beach, such as this one, carry particular value.</p><p>Moreover, furnished apartments ready for immediate use are highly attractive in the rental market. Holidaymakers appreciate being able to move straight in, and long-term tenants value the functional setup. With careful management, this apartment can deliver strong rental income throughout the year, making it not just a home but a working investment.</p><h2>Why Work with Luxury Estate Turkey?</h2><p>Purchasing property abroad requires more than just a signature. It requires trust, knowledge, and long-term support. At Luxury Estate Turkey, we provide all three.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Clear Guidance from Day One</strong>&ndash; We walk clients through every step, from first viewing to final handover.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and Practical Support</strong>&ndash; Contracts, utilities, and residence permit processes are handled with professionalism.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market Insight</strong>&ndash; Our team explains not just the property but also the neighborhood dynamics, rental potential, and resale outlook.</p></li><li><p><strong>Multilingual Communication</strong>&ndash; We ensure clarity by working in multiple languages, removing barriers for international buyers.</p></li><li><p><strong>After-Sales Commitment</strong>&ndash; Even after the purchase, we continue to provide management, rental, and resale services.</p></li></ul><p>For serious buyers, we also organize inspection trips, allowing you to experience Oba firsthand before making a decision.</p><p>When you choose us, you gain more than an agent &mdash; you gain a partner dedicated to making your purchase both secure and rewarding.</p><p>This renovated and fully furnished 2 room, 65 m&sup2; apartment in Oba offers far more than square meters.

    "property_title": "Spacious Apartment in Alanya Center Yekta Vizyon Park Complex",
    "property_description": "<div><h2>Furnished 2 Room Apartment for Sale in Yekta Vizyon Park Alanya</h2><p>If you are looking for a<strong>2 room<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya/apartments\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">apartment for sale in Alanya</a></strong>, Yekta Vizyon Park offers much more than the typical city flat. While most two-room apartments in the area measure only 45&ndash;50 m&sup2;, this property stretches to a spacious<strong>70 m&sup2;</strong>, giving you noticeably more comfort in daily living. The home also stands out with<strong>two glass balconies</strong>, both south-facing and overlooking the city&mdash;features rarely found in apartments of this size.</p><p>The residence itself reflects a<strong>modern and urban lifestyle</strong>. It is designed for people who want the convenience of living in Alanya&rsquo;s center while enjoying the privacy of a secure complex. With amenities such as fitness, sauna, a large car park, a lobby, and round-the-clock security, Yekta Vizyon Park combines city life with comfort in a way that appeals to professionals, couples, and investors alike.</p><h2>Interior &ndash; Designed for a Practical City Life</h2><p>The apartment&rsquo;s interior focuses on<strong>simplicity and function without sacrificing style</strong>. Entering the living area, you find an open-plan kitchen and lounge that create one unified, flowing space.</p><p>The<strong>kitchen</strong>uses white cabinets with a contrasting black countertop and metro-style tiles. This clean and classic pairing works well for everyday use and is easy to maintain. The flooring distinguishes between areas: wood-effect laminate in the living section for warmth, and white marble-look ceramic in the kitchen for durability. Spilled coffee or cooking mishaps are no cause for worry&mdash;it&rsquo;s practical and designed for real life.</p><p>The<strong>living room</strong>is arranged with a large sofa and a sleek TV unit, emphasizing comfort for quieter living rather than big gatherings. LED spotlights and modern ceiling fixtures add a contemporary touch. The overall effect is modern yet understated&mdash;ideal for those who prefer a clutter-free environment.</p><p>In the<strong>bedroom</strong>, light-colored furniture and a modern wardrobe keep the atmosphere fresh. The layout is deliberately simple, leaving room for the new owner to add personal touches. Whether you prefer minimal d&eacute;cor or a more decorative style, this neutral backdrop makes customization easy.</p><h2>The Highlight &ndash; Two Glass Balconies</h2><p>Balconies often make or break an Alanya apartment, and here they are clearly the highlight. Instead of one, this home has<strong>two enclosed glass balconies</strong>, a rare feature in city-center living.</p><p>These spaces extend your living area and allow year-round use. Even in cooler months, you can sit comfortably behind the glass while enjoying city views. One of the balconies can easily be turned into a<strong>home office corner</strong>for remote workers, while the other remains a social space for coffee breaks or evening relaxation. This flexibility makes the apartment suitable not only for permanent living but also for digital nomads seeking a balanced lifestyle.</p><h2>Yekta Vizyon Park Complex That Adds Real Value</h2><p>Yekta Vizyon Park is not just about the apartment itself&mdash;the complex adds significant lifestyle advantages. It includes:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Fitness center</strong>&ndash; Fully equipped for daily workouts without leaving home</p></li><li><p><strong>Sauna</strong>&ndash; A relaxing space to recharge after work</p></li><li><p><strong>Swimming pool</strong>&ndash; Ideal for hot Alanya summers</p></li><li><p><strong>Lobby and caretaker services</strong>&ndash; Adding security and convenience</p></li><li><p><strong>Large open and underground parking areas</strong>&ndash; A rare luxury in the city center</p></li><li><p><strong>Barbecue pavilion and landscaped communal areas</strong>&ndash; Spaces to socialize and relax</p></li><li><p><strong>24/7 security and camera system</strong>&ndash; Ensuring peace of mind at all times</p></li></ul><p>This combination of facilities makes the complex especially attractive to buyers who want the city center&rsquo;s advantages but do not want to compromise on comfort or security.</p><h2>Who Will Find This Apartment Ideal?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Young professionals</strong>&ndash; With fitness, sauna, and parking at hand, the apartment offers a lifestyle where you can work, exercise, and relax all in one place. After work, you can easily step into the city&rsquo;s restaurants or caf&eacute;s.</p></li><li><p><strong>Couples</strong>&ndash; A modern, manageable space in the heart of Alanya, perfect for enjoying city life together. Everything you need&mdash;shops, beaches, transport&mdash;is within walking distance.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>&ndash; City-center apartments with social amenities are always in demand. This home offers strong potential for both long-term and short-term rentals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Solo residents or digital nomads</strong>&ndash; With two glass balconies, one can serve as a home office, making it an excellent choice for remote workers.</p></li></ul><h2>Everyday Life in Alanya&rsquo;s Center</h2><p>Living in the<strong>heart of Alanya</strong>comes with undeniable advantages. The streets are filled with shops, boutiques, coffee houses, and international restaurants. You are close to everything&mdash;from grocery stores and pharmacies to modern fashion brands and electronics shops. Jewelry stores and cosmetic outlets add variety, while the city&rsquo;s malls and local markets offer plenty of shopping choices.</p><p>Touristic landmarks are never far. Within walking distance are the<strong>Red Tower (Kızıl Kule)</strong>, the historic<strong>Alanya Castle</strong>, and the old shipyard. The famous<strong>Damlataş Cave</strong>and<strong>cable car</strong>to the castle are also nearby. The central location means you can combine sightseeing, shopping, and beach time all in the same day.</p><p>Transportation is easy. Public buses pass frequently, connecting you to all parts of Alanya. Route 101 runs along the coast, reaching every major beach, while buses 202A and 202B head inland to other neighborhoods. Taxis are available on every main street, making mobility effortless.</p><p>And of course, living in the center means you are close to<strong>Damlataş Beach</strong>and<strong>Kleopatra Beach</strong>, two of the most famous beaches in Turkey. A morning swim, an afternoon coffee, and an evening stroll along the harbor&mdash;all become part of daily life.</p><h2>Investment Perspective</h2><p>From an investment standpoint, this apartment checks all the right boxes. Properties in Alanya&rsquo;s center are always in demand, particularly those inside modern complexes with social facilities. This is not just a flat in a central building; it is part of a<strong>full-service residence</strong>that appeals to tenants and buyers alike.</p><p>The larger-than-standard size (70 m&sup2; instead of 45&ndash;50 m&sup2;) makes it more comfortable for long-term tenants, while the two glass balconies provide extra appeal for digital nomads and younger renters. With the strong demand for centrally located apartments, rental returns are expected to remain high.</p><p>In addition, central Alanya has limited space for new developments, meaning supply is restricted. This naturally supports long-term property value growth, ensuring both rental income and resale potential for future owners.</p><p>Here's a more natural and human-written version in English:</p><h2>Why Choose Us for Your Alanya Property Journey?</h2><p>We get it - buying property abroad can feel overwhelming. That's exactly where we come in. Our goal is simple: make this journey<strong>safe, transparent, and completely stress-free</strong>for you.</p><p><strong>What We Bring to the Table:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Straight talk</strong>&ndash; We give you the real story on pricing, neighborhoods, and what makes sense as an investment</li><li><strong>Legal backup</strong>&ndash; From title transfers to notary work and tax questions, we've got you covered</li><li><strong>Residency and citizenship help</strong>&ndash; Whether you want Turkish residence or citizenship through investment, we'll walk you through it</li><li><strong>We speak your language</strong>&ndash; Literally. Our team handles multiple languages so there's never a communication barrier</li><li><strong>We're here after the sale too</strong>&ndash; Setting up utilities, helping with furniture, managing rentals - whatever you need</li><li><strong>Come see for yourself</strong>&ndash; We arrange site visits for our international clients because nothing beats seeing it in person</li></ul><p>We've been doing this for years, and we know Alanya inside and out. But more than that, we genuinely care about making sure you're happy with your purchase. It's not just about the transaction - it's about your whole experience.</p><h3>Let's Make This Happen!</h3><p>This<strong>2-bedroom apartment in Yekta Vizyon Park Alanya</strong>really is something special. You're getting more space than usual, those gorgeous glass balconies, all the modern touches, and you're right in the heart of everything. Whether this becomes your new home, a rental investment, or your perfect getaway spot, it's a property that just makes sense.</p><p>Give us a call to set up a viewing or if you want to know more.

    "property_description": "<div><h2>2 Room Apartment for Sale in City 8 Residence Alanya Center &ndash; Compact Modern Living Steps from the Sea</h2><p>In the heart of<a href=\"https://luxuryestateturkey.com/en/real-estate/turkey/alanya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alanya</a>, where caf&eacute;s, shops, and beaches are all within walking distance, a practical home can make life simple and enjoyable. This<strong>2 room apartment for sale in Alanya</strong>, located in<strong>City 8 Residence</strong>, offers exactly that. With a compact but well-designed 46 m&sup2; layout, fully furnished interiors, and access to a modern pool and fitness facilities, it is a smart choice for those who want convenience without giving up style.</p><p>Just 50 meters from the city center and 750 meters from the sea, the apartment provides a lifestyle where everything is nearby. From morning swims to late-night caf&eacute;s, everything you need is right outside your door.</p><h2>Interior Features &ndash; Minimalist, Bright, and Functional</h2><p>The apartment&rsquo;s design follows a modern, clean line. Floors are finished with glossy porcelain tiles that reflect light and make the space feel larger. White-painted walls create a fresh background that enhances the sense of openness. Spotlights and pendant lamps bring in a contemporary atmosphere, making evenings cozy yet stylish.</p><h3>Living Room &amp; Kitchen</h3><p>The living room features a grey L-shaped sofa with geometric patterned cushions, both modern and functional. Instead of a bulky TV unit, the television is mounted directly on the wall, which is a clever minimalist solution. The space could easily be personalized with decorative artwork, a mirror, or niche shelving to give the room more character.</p><p>The dining area adds contrast: a marble-look table paired with deep burgundy chairs. The combination is bold and works well, but placing a decorative vase, fresh flowers, or a soft-toned runner could bring additional warmth.</p><p>The kitchen is finished with glossy white cabinets and a black countertop, creating a sharp and elegant contrast. It is fully equipped with oven, stove, and washing machine, ensuring functionality in a compact layout. For those who enjoy cooking, upgrading the backsplash with modern tiles&mdash;like grey mosaics or shiny metro tiles&mdash;would instantly elevate the look.</p><h3>Bedroom</h3><p>The bedroom is simple but effective. A grey upholstered headboard sets a modern tone, while patterned bedding adds a friendly, lived-in feel. Switching to single-tone linens in beige, cream, or soft grey could create a more luxurious hotel-style look.</p><p>A large window and balcony door flood the room with daylight. Dark curtains are practical for sleeping, while adding wall art, a rug, or bedside lamps could make the room more stylish.</p><h3>Balcony</h3><p>Though small, the balcony is practical and inviting. A compact glass table with two chairs offers the perfect setting for morning coffee or evening tea. With a few cushions, potted plants, or even an outdoor rug, it could easily become a cozy extension of the living room.</p><h2>Lifestyle in City 8 Residence</h2><p>City 8 Residence is designed for modern living in the city center. Despite its compact size, the complex includes features that enhance daily comfort:</p><ul><li><p>Outdoor swimming pool</p></li><li><p>Fitness center</p></li><li><p>Barbecue area</p></li><li><p>24/7 security cameras and caretaker service</p></li><li><p>Generator and satellite TV connection</p></li><li><p>Children&rsquo;s pool and small playground</p></li></ul><p>These facilities mean you can swim, work out, or socialize without leaving home. The building&rsquo;s central location also ensures you are never far from Alanya&rsquo;s daily life.</p><h2>Who Is This Apartment For?</h2><ul><li><p><strong>Young couples</strong>: Perfect as a first home or holiday base. Its central location makes daily routines easy and enjoyable.</p></li><li><p><strong>Small families</strong>: While compact, the apartment&rsquo;s facilities and proximity to the beach offer a relaxed lifestyle.</p></li><li><p><strong>Investors</strong>: Compact 2 room apartments near the sea are always in demand for holiday rentals. Its central address and ready-to-move-in furnishings make it attractive to tenants.</p></li><li><p><strong>Digital nomads or professionals</strong>: The layout works well for someone working remotely. Add a desk near the balcony, and you have a bright home office combined with city-center convenience.</p></li></ul><h2>Everyday Life in Alanya Center</h2><p>Living here means being in the busiest, most vibrant part of Alanya. Streets are lined with international restaurants, cozy caf&eacute;s, and fashionable boutiques. From stylish coffee shops to traditional bakeries, options are endless.</p><p>Historic landmarks such as the<strong>Red Tower (Kızıl Kule)</strong>,<strong>Alanya Castle</strong>, and the old shipyard are close by. For shopping, Alanya offers everything from jewelry stores to electronics and cosmetics shops. International brands sit next to local boutiques, creating a mix of global and local experiences.</p><p>Transportation is simple. The 101 bus line runs along the coast, connecting all major beaches. The 202 routes reach other districts such as Oba and Tosmur. Taxis are easy to find, and most daily needs are accessible by foot.</p><p>For leisure,<strong>Damlataş Beach, Damlataş Cave, and the Alanya Cable Car</strong>are nearby. You can explore the castle in the morning, shop in the afternoon, and enjoy dinner by the sea in the evening&mdash;all within walking distance.</p><h2>Investment Potential</h2><p>From an investment perspective, City 8 Residence is an excellent opportunity. Compact apartments in central locations remain some of the most profitable real estate in Alanya. Holiday rentals attract tourists who want both the beach and nightlife close by. Long-term rentals appeal to professionals, students, and digital nomads who value central living.</p><p>Property prices in Alanya center continue to rise steadily, driven by international demand and limited supply of new homes in prime locations. Buying here means securing both lifestyle and capital growth.</p><h2>Experience, Honesty, and Ongoing Support</h2><p>At Luxury Estate Turkey, we know that buying property abroad can feel overwhelming. That is why we provide clear, honest advice and stay with you every step of the way.</p><p>Our services include:</p><ul><li><p>Guidance on paperwork, contracts, and title deeds</p></li><li><p>Support for residence permits and citizenship through property purchase</p></li><li><p>Multilingual communication for full clarity</p></li><li><p>After-sales services such as utility setup, furnishing, and rental management</p></li></ul><p>What makes us different is that our commitment continues long after the sale. Clients know they can contact us months or years later for support. That ongoing relationship is part of what builds trust.</p><p>This<strong>2 room apartment for sale in City 8 Residence Alanya</strong>offers more than just a home&mdash;it combines compact functionality with central convenience. Fully furnished and ready to move in, it is ideal for living, renting, or investing.</p><p>Contact us today to arrange a private viewing or receive more information.

    "property_description": "<div><p data-start=\"620\" data-end=\"960\">In the heart of Mahmutlar, one of Alanya’s most vibrant and international neighborhoods, this<strong data-start=\"714\" data-end=\"758\">115 m², fully furnished 3 room apartment</strong>presents a rare opportunity. Combining spacious interiors, a bright south-west orientation, and the convenience of being just<strong data-start=\"885\" data-end=\"912\">500 meters from the sea</strong>, it offers both comfort and investment value.</p><p data-start=\"962\" data-end=\"1252\">The apartment is part of a well-equipped<strong data-start=\"1003\" data-end=\"1073\">residence with pool, landscaped garden, fitness, and 24/7 security</strong>. With a partial sea and city view, a wide balcony, and tasteful furniture already in place, this home is ready to welcome its new owners without the hassle of additional setup.</p><h2 data-start=\"2949\" data-end=\"2997\">Interior Atmosphere – Spacious and Inviting</h2><p data-start=\"2999\" data-end=\"3216\">With its<strong data-start=\"3008\" data-end=\"3034\">115 m² of living space</strong>, this apartment feels noticeably more generous than standard layouts in Mahmutlar. Each room has been thoughtfully decorated, combining functionality with a warm, welcoming style.</p><h3 data-start=\"3218\" data-end=\"3258\">Living Room – Retro-Modern Balance</h3><p data-start=\"3259\" data-end=\"3683\">The living room is arranged with<strong data-start=\"3292\" data-end=\"3326\">turquoise and mint green sofas</strong>, creating a retro-modern look. Pastel tones give a light summer house feel, while the symmetrical arrangement of furniture provides harmony and order. A well-placed rug softens the coolness of the ceramic floor, while classic-style lighting fixtures add charm. If desired, these can be updated to minimal or contemporary designs for an even fresher look.</p><h3 data-start=\"3685\" data-end=\"3722\">Kitchen – Practical and Stylish</h3><p data-start=\"3723\" data-end=\"4014\">The kitchen runs along a linear wall, maximizing space efficiency. Upper cabinets in glossy white are contrasted by darker lower cabinets, adding depth and elegance. A mosaic-patterned backsplash gives character to the room, while a small dining set fits perfectly within the kitchen area.</p><h3 data-start=\"4016\" data-end=\"4056\">Bedrooms – Comfort and Flexibility</h3><ul data-start=\"4057\" data-end=\"4466\"><li data-start=\"4057\" data-end=\"4284\"><p data-start=\"4059\" data-end=\"4284\"><strong data-start=\"4059\" data-end=\"4078\">Master Bedroom:</strong>Spacious, opening directly onto the balcony through wide glass doors. Classic white furniture (wardrobe, dresser, nightstands) is paired with warm wooden details, creating a timeless and cozy atmosphere.</p></li><li data-start=\"4285\" data-end=\"4466\"><p data-start=\"4287\" data-end=\"4466\"><strong data-start=\"4287\" data-end=\"4306\">Second Bedroom:</strong>Designed with two single beds, making it ideal for children, guests, or even as a home office. Neutral walls and natural light allow for flexible decoration.</p></li></ul><h3 data-start=\"4468\" data-end=\"4517\">Balcony – The Heart of Mediterranean Living</h3><p data-start=\"962\" data-end=\"1252\"> </p><p data-start=\"4518\" data-end=\"4811\">The<strong data-start=\"4522\" data-end=\"4549\">wide, semi-oval balcony</strong>is one of the strongest assets of this property. Big enough to be used as a dining or lounge area, it effectively extends the living space outdoors. With a mix of<strong data-start=\"4713\" data-end=\"4749\">city energy and partial sea view</strong>, evenings on this balcony become a highlight of daily life.</p><h2 data-start=\"4818\" data-end=\"4854\">Residence and Social Facilities</h2><p data-start=\"4856\" data-end=\"4961\">This apartment is part of a<strong data-start=\"4884\" data-end=\"4911\">full-facility residence</strong>, designed to provide both leisure and security:</p><ul data-start=\"4962\" data-end=\"5246\"><li data-start=\"4962\" data-end=\"4987\"><p data-start=\"4964\" data-end=\"4987\">Outdoor swimming pool</p></li><li data-start=\"4988\" data-end=\"5007\"><p data-start=\"4990\" data-end=\"5007\">Children’s pool</p></li><li data-start=\"5008\" data-end=\"5061\"><p data-start=\"5010\" data-end=\"5061\">Landscaped garden with pergolas and seating areas</p></li><li data-start=\"5062\" data-end=\"5113\"><p data-start=\"5064\" data-end=\"5113\">Barbecue and gazebo areas for social gatherings</p></li><li data-start=\"5114\" data-end=\"5136\"><p data-start=\"5116\" data-end=\"5136\">Fitness facilities</p></li><li data-start=\"5137\" data-end=\"5161\"><p data-start=\"5139\" data-end=\"5161\">Sauna and steam room</p></li><li data-start=\"5162\" data-end=\"5197\"><p data-start=\"5164\" data-end=\"5197\">24/7 security and camera system</p></li><li data-start=\"5198\" data-end=\"5219\"><p data-start=\"5200\" data-end=\"5219\">On-site caretaker</p></li><li data-start=\"5220\" data-end=\"5232\"><p data-start=\"5222\" data-end=\"5232\">Elevator</p></li><li data-start=\"5233\" data-end=\"5246\"><p data-start=\"5235\" data-end=\"5246\">Generator</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"4518\" data-end=\"4811\"> </p><p data-start=\"5248\" data-end=\"5336\">With these features, residents can enjoy a resort-like lifestyle without leaving home.</p><h2 data-start=\"1259\" data-end=\"1305\">Mahmutlar – A District That Offers It All</h2><p data-start=\"1307\" data-end=\"1577\">Mahmutlar has become one of the most desirable areas of Alanya, loved by both locals and a strong expat community. Stretching along the Mediterranean coastline and backed by the Taurus Mountains, it combines the calm of residential living with the vibrancy of tourism.</p><p data-start=\"1579\" data-end=\"1626\">Here, daily life is exceptionally convenient:</p><ul data-start=\"1627\" data-end=\"2040\"><li data-start=\"1627\" data-end=\"1717\"><p data-start=\"1629\" data-end=\"1717\">Local shops such as<strong data-start=\"1649\" data-end=\"1692\">butchers, bakeries, and hardware stores</strong>are spread throughout.</p></li><li data-start=\"1718\" data-end=\"1835\"><p data-start=\"1720\" data-end=\"1835\">Every<strong data-start=\"1726\" data-end=\"1737\">Tuesday</strong>, the open-air bazaar fills the streets with fresh fruits, vegetables, and regional specialties.</p></li><li data-start=\"1836\" data-end=\"1931\"><p data-start=\"1838\" data-end=\"1931\">Modern shopping centers like<strong data-start=\"1867\" data-end=\"1897\">YektaMall and Akdeniz Park</strong>are just a short distance away.</p></li><li data-start=\"1932\" data-end=\"2040\"><p data-start=\"1934\" data-end=\"2040\">Cafés run by local families sit alongside international chains, giving residents endless dining choices.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"2042\" data-end=\"2401\">Transport connections are seamless. Buses run every 10 minutes to Alanya center, local minibuses circulate within Mahmutlar and neighboring districts, and taxis are readily available. For those who enjoy active lifestyles, the coastal roads are ideal for cycling, while the nearby<strong data-start=\"2323\" data-end=\"2343\">Taurus Mountains</strong>provide excellent opportunities for hiking and picnics.</p><h2 data-start=\"5343\" data-end=\"5396\">Lifestyle Scenarios – Who Is This Apartment For?</h2><h3 data-start=\"5398\" data-end=\"5412\">Families</h3><p data-start=\"5413\" data-end=\"5665\">The spacious 115 m² layout provides two full bedrooms, a large living room, and a wide balcony. For families with children, the residence offers safe play areas and swimming pools. Proximity to schools, shops, and the beach ensures daily convenience.</p><h3 data-start=\"5667\" data-end=\"5707\">International Buyers and Investors</h3><p data-start=\"5708\" data-end=\"5957\">Located only 500 meters from the sea and within a modern residence, this apartment is highly attractive for<strong data-start=\"5816\" data-end=\"5844\">short-term rental income</strong>. Fully furnished, it requires no additional investment, making it ideal for buyers who want immediate returns.</p><h3 data-start=\"5959\" data-end=\"5973\">Retirees</h3><p data-start=\"5974\" data-end=\"6189\">With its south-west orientation, wide balcony, and central location, the apartment offers a relaxed lifestyle. Everything from cafés to markets is within walking distance, reducing the need for constant transport.</p><h3 data-start=\"6191\" data-end=\"6217\">Holiday Home Seekers</h3><p data-start=\"6218\" data-end=\"6418\">For those who want a ready-to-use holiday base, the apartment’s full furnishing eliminates the hassle of moving or decorating. Simply bring your luggage and start enjoying life by the Mediterranean.</p><h2 data-start=\"6425\" data-end=\"6482\">Investment Potential – Why This Apartment Stands Out</h2><p data-start=\"6484\" data-end=\"6677\">Mahmutlar’s real estate market continues to show strong appreciation, driven by its international popularity and ongoing development. This apartment has several standout investment qualities:</p><ul data-start=\"6679\" data-end=\"7142\"><li data-start=\"6679\" data-end=\"6760\"><p data-start=\"6681\" data-end=\"6760\"><strong data-start=\"6681\" data-end=\"6700\">Prime Location:</strong>Only 500 meters from the sea, around 6–7 minutes on foot.</p></li><li data-start=\"6761\" data-end=\"6849\"><p data-start=\"6763\" data-end=\"6849\"><strong data-start=\"6763\" data-end=\"6782\">Size Advantage:</strong>At 115 m², it is considerably larger than many similar listings.</p></li><li data-start=\"6850\" data-end=\"6936\"><p data-start=\"6852\" data-end=\"6936\"><strong data-start=\"6852\" data-end=\"6870\">Ready-to-Rent:</strong>Being fully furnished, it can generate immediate rental income.</p></li><li data-start=\"6937\" data-end=\"7035\"><p data-start=\"6939\" data-end=\"7035\"><strong data-start=\"6939\" data-end=\"6963\">Residence Amenities:</strong>Pools, sauna, fitness, and gardens increase rental and resale appeal.</p></li><li data-start=\"7036\" data-end=\"7142\"><p data-start=\"7038\" data-end=\"7142\"><strong data-start=\"7038\" data-end=\"7055\">Modern Build:</strong>Recent construction ensures up-to-date infrastructure and reduced maintenance costs.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"7144\" data-end=\"7243\">Together, these features ensure both<strong data-start=\"7181\" data-end=\"7202\">high rental yield</strong>and<strong data-start=\"7207\" data-end=\"7240\">strong long-term value growth</strong>.</p><h2 data-start=\"7250\" data-end=\"7287\">Why Choose Luxury Estate Turkey?</h2><p data-start=\"7289\" data-end=\"7448\">Buying property in Alanya should feel secure, straightforward, and rewarding.

    "property_title": "Gold City: From 5-Star Hotel Facilities to Your Own Residence!",
    "property_description": "<div><p>If every summer you come to Alanya and you&rsquo;re tired of queuing at open buffets and racing to grab a sunbed, this property is for you. Instead of chasing a hotel reservation, you get a home<strong data-start=\"516\" data-end=\"526\">inside</strong>the city&rsquo;s most recognizable resort complex &mdash;<strong data-start=\"573\" data-end=\"586\">Gold City</strong>in Alanya&mdash; where the services feel hotel-level yet the apartment is yours to enjoy year-round.</p><h2 data-start=\"690\" data-end=\"738\">A Resort Everyone Knows in Alanya</h2><p data-start=\"740\" data-end=\"1283\">Gold City is one of those addresses people recognize on day one. The complex operates with hotel standards and residential comfort side by side, which means daily life here comes with a ready-made lifestyle: restaurants, bars, patisserie, spa and wellness, indoor and outdoor pools, aquapark, sports courts, cinema, bowling, billiards, and extensive green areas. Moreover, a<strong data-start=\"1115\" data-end=\"1139\">shuttle to the beach</strong>solves the only &ldquo;distance&rdquo; detail &mdash; the sea sits<strong data-start=\"1189\" data-end=\"1199\">2.5 km</strong>away, but you&rsquo;ll reach the coast without thinking about parking, traffic, or taxis.</p><p data-start=\"1285\" data-end=\"1623\">Kargıcak itself lies on Alanya&rsquo;s eastern side and favors space, scenery, and a calmer rhythm. Consequently, buyers who prefer privacy but still want fast access to the city often shortlist this area. Within that context, Gold City stands like a small city on its own, so everyday needs shift from &ldquo;planning ahead&rdquo; to &ldquo;walking downstairs.&rdquo;</p><h2 data-start=\"1625\" data-end=\"1675\">The Apartment in Alanya, Gold City Complex</h2><p data-start=\"1677\" data-end=\"2163\">You&rsquo;re looking at a<strong data-start=\"1697\" data-end=\"1707\">3 room</strong>apartment totaling<strong data-start=\"1727\" data-end=\"1737\">100 m&sup2;</strong>. The plan prioritizes clarity and comfort: a bright living area with an open kitchen, two restful bedrooms, and a practical bathroom setup that supports both daily routines and longer stays. Because the property is<strong data-start=\"1953\" data-end=\"1966\">furnished</strong>and<strong data-start=\"1971\" data-end=\"1986\">white goods</strong>are included, you skip the furnishing phase entirely and move straight to living. Airy proportions, clean lines, and a soft color palette help the rooms feel bigger and calmer.</p><ul data-start=\"2165\" data-end=\"2469\"><li data-start=\"2165\" data-end=\"2253\"><p data-start=\"2167\" data-end=\"2253\"><strong data-start=\"2167\" data-end=\"2178\">Layout:</strong>3 rooms arranged for effortless flow between living, dining, and cooking</p></li><li data-start=\"2254\" data-end=\"2324\"><p data-start=\"2256\" data-end=\"2324\"><strong data-start=\"2256\" data-end=\"2265\">Size:</strong><strong data-start=\"2266\" data-end=\"2276\">100 m&sup2;</strong>that uses light tones to enhance spaciousness</p></li><li data-start=\"2325\" data-end=\"2398\"><p data-start=\"2327\" data-end=\"2398\"><strong data-start=\"2327\" data-end=\"2341\">Condition:</strong><strong data-start=\"2342\" data-end=\"2355\">Furnished</strong>,<strong data-start=\"2357\" data-end=\"2372\">white goods</strong>and essentials in place</p></li><li data-start=\"2399\" data-end=\"2469\"><p data-start=\"2401\" data-end=\"2469\"><strong data-start=\"2401\" data-end=\"2416\">Atmosphere:</strong>Hotel-inspired neatness blended with at-home comfort</p></li></ul><h3 data-start=\"2471\" data-end=\"2517\">Interior Mood &mdash; Calm, Modern, and Cohesive</h3><p data-start=\"2519\" data-end=\"2981\">The interior reads &ldquo;relax&rdquo; from the doorway. Light beige walls connect seamlessly with neutral flooring; furniture pieces in cream and sand tones create a restful base; blue accents echo the sea views and introduce a cool, coastal note without clich&eacute;s. The open kitchen balances white lacquer cabinets with a dark countertop; it is a classic, timeless pairing that stays fresh as trends change. Therefore, the apartment feels current now and will age gracefully.</p><p data-start=\"2983\" data-end=\"3353\">Bedrooms continue the same language: upholstered headboards, practical storage, and textiles in blue-gray shades. Mirrors and lighting are chosen to add brightness rather than drama, so the ambience remains gentle. The result is an interior that resembles a well-kept hotel suite but behaves like a private home &mdash; you control the schedule, the noise, and the guest list.</p><h3 data-start=\"3355\" data-end=\"3401\">Balcony Life &mdash; Bring the View to the Table</h3><p data-start=\"3403\" data-end=\"3797\">The<strong data-start=\"3407\" data-end=\"3418\">balcony</strong>acts like a second living room. A lively orange outdoor set lifts the neutral interior scheme and draws you outside. From here, the panorama frames<strong data-start=\"3567\" data-end=\"3592\">Alanya&rsquo;s green slopes</strong>,<strong data-start=\"3594\" data-end=\"3615\">the Mediterranean</strong>, and, where the angle allows,<strong data-start=\"3646\" data-end=\"3667\">the iconic castle</strong>. On slow mornings you take coffee with that horizon; on warm evenings you swap the hotel terrace crowd for your own quiet corner.</p><h2 data-start=\"3799\" data-end=\"3840\">Hotel-Style Amenities You Actually Use</h2><p data-start=\"3842\" data-end=\"4033\">Because the apartment sits inside<strong data-start=\"3876\" data-end=\"3889\">Gold City</strong>, your daily life expands far beyond your front door.

The kids are already asking about the<strong data-start=\"6461\" data-end=\"6473\">aquapark</strong>. You check the time and decide to do<strong data-start=\"6511\" data-end=\"6521\">tennis</strong>first, then pool time, then a beach afternoon. Because the<strong data-start=\"6581\" data-end=\"6592\">shuttle</strong>runs on a regular loop, you don&rsquo;t negotiate parking near the shore; you simply go when you&rsquo;re ready and return when naps call. Dinner rotates between the apartment and the<strong data-start=\"6765\" data-end=\"6788\">on-site restaurants</strong>&mdash; no reservation stress, no city-center traffic. Consequently, holidays feel like holidays, even in August.</p><h3 data-start=\"6898\" data-end=\"6963\">For long-stay owners who want hotel perks without hotel rules</h3><p data-start=\"6964\" data-end=\"7371\">You return from a morning run on the<strong data-start=\"7001\" data-end=\"7010\">track</strong>, cool down in the<strong data-start=\"7029\" data-end=\"7038\">sauna</strong>, and book a<strong data-start=\"7051\" data-end=\"7067\">massage room</strong>for Friday. Guests are coming next week; you pick up fresh desserts at the<strong data-start=\"7143\" data-end=\"7157\">patisserie</strong>instead of baking. If the weather shifts, the<strong data-start=\"7204\" data-end=\"7219\">indoor pool</strong>saves the day. Maintenance?<strong data-start=\"7248\" data-end=\"7261\">Caretaker</strong>and<strong data-start=\"7266\" data-end=\"7287\">cleaning services</strong>exist for that. Meanwhile, your<strong data-start=\"7320\" data-end=\"7331\">fitness</strong>routine continues regardless of season.</p><h3 data-start=\"7373\" data-end=\"7428\">For investors who think in occupancy rate and yield</h3><p data-start=\"7429\" data-end=\"7887\">This address sells itself. The phrase &ldquo;<strong data-start=\"7468\" data-end=\"7498\">apartment inside Gold City</strong>&rdquo; has brand recognition, so your listing doesn&rsquo;t need a long explanation. Furnished interiors and<strong data-start=\"7596\" data-end=\"7611\">white goods</strong>allow turn-key rental starts. The<strong data-start=\"7646\" data-end=\"7657\">shuttle</strong>, the<strong data-start=\"7663\" data-end=\"7680\">private beach</strong>access, and the sheer variety of on-site activities broaden your tenant pool to families, couples, and friends traveling together. Therefore, occupancy potential rises across both high and shoulder seasons.</p><h2 data-start=\"7889\" data-end=\"7940\">Property in Alanya &mdash; Why Gold City Complex Still Matters</h2><p data-start=\"7942\" data-end=\"8486\">When buyers search for<strong data-start=\"7965\" data-end=\"7987\">property in Alanya</strong>, they compare beachfront proximity, facilities, and neighborhood rhythm. Gold City competes differently: it delivers a<strong data-start=\"8107\" data-end=\"8127\">resort ecosystem</strong>that compresses the practical parts of daily life into one managed environment. In addition,<strong data-start=\"8221\" data-end=\"8233\">Kargıcak</strong>gives you open views, quieter streets, and larger green frames than you&rsquo;d expect closer to the center. If you host friends, the<strong data-start=\"8362\" data-end=\"8372\">cinema</strong>,<strong data-start=\"8374\" data-end=\"8385\">bowling</strong>, and<strong data-start=\"8391\" data-end=\"8404\">billiards</strong>are an elevator ride away; if you want calm, the balcony and gardens are waiting.</p><p data-start=\"8488\" data-end=\"8824\">Because the complex includes<strong data-start=\"8517\" data-end=\"8535\">hotel services</strong>, upkeep stays consistent and public areas remain polished. That matters after purchase. As a result, common spaces age more gracefully than in small, under-resourced sites. It is not only about today&rsquo;s comfort; it is also about the<strong data-start=\"8768\" data-end=\"8787\">long-term value</strong>of the environment around your home.</p><h2 data-start=\"8826\" data-end=\"8869\">Investment Angle &mdash; Why This Apartment in Alanya Works</h2><ul data-start=\"8871\" data-end=\"9464\"><li data-start=\"8871\" data-end=\"8962\"><p data-start=\"8873\" data-end=\"8962\"><strong data-start=\"8873\" data-end=\"8888\">Brand pull:</strong>&ldquo;Gold City&rdquo; helps your listing win clicks before the first photo loads.</p></li><li data-start=\"8963\" data-end=\"9076\"><p data-start=\"8965\" data-end=\"9076\"><strong data-start=\"8965\" data-end=\"8988\">Turn-key condition:</strong><strong data-start=\"8989\" data-end=\"9002\">Furnished</strong>with<strong data-start=\"9008\" data-end=\"9023\">white goods</strong>shortens vacancy windows and reduces set-up costs.</p></li><li data-start=\"9077\" data-end=\"9222\"><p data-start=\"9079\" data-end=\"9222\"><strong data-start=\"9079\" data-end=\"9106\">Amenities as marketing:</strong>You are not just renting square meters; you&rsquo;re offering<strong data-start=\"9163\" data-end=\"9206\">aquapark + beach shuttle + spa + sports</strong>in one price.</p></li><li data-start=\"9223\" data-end=\"9348\"><p data-start=\"9225\" data-end=\"9348\"><strong data-start=\"9225\" data-end=\"9253\">Multiple buyer profiles:</strong>Families, retirees, digital workers, and holidaymakers all understand the value proposition.</p></li><li data-start=\"9349\" data-end=\"9464\"><p data-start=\"9351\" data-end=\"9464\"><strong data-start=\"9351\" data-end=\"9371\">Cash efficiency:</strong>The<strong data-start=\"9376\" data-end=\"9409\">cash payment &ndash; discount offer</strong>(subject to seller terms) can improve your cost basis.</p></li></ul><p data-start=\"9466\" data-end=\"9671\">For a longer hold, your downside is hedged by utility: even if market cycles soften, this kind of<strong data-start=\"9564\" data-end=\"9586\">property in Alanya</strong>remains livable and rentable because it solves daily needs, not just holiday dreams.</p><h2 data-start=\"9673\" data-end=\"9709\">Who Will Love This Home the Most?</h2><ul data-start=\"9711\" data-end=\"10192\"><li data-start=\"9711\" data-end=\"9806\"><p data-start=\"9713\" data-end=\"9806\"><strong data-start=\"9713\" data-end=\"9725\">Families</strong>who want pools, aquapark, sports courts, and<strong data-start=\"9771\" data-end=\"9796\">children&rsquo;s play areas</strong>on site</p></li><li data-start=\"9807\" data-end=\"9885\"><p data-start=\"9809\" data-end=\"9885\"><strong data-start=\"9809\" data-end=\"9833\">Holiday-first owners</strong>who crave hotel variety without hotel limitations</p></li><li data-start=\"9886\" data-end=\"9953\"><p data-start=\"9888\" data-end=\"9953\"><strong data-start=\"9888\" data-end=\"9901\">Investors</strong>seeking brand recognition and broad renter appeal</p></li><li data-start=\"9954\" data-end=\"10077\"><p data-start=\"9956\" data-end=\"10077\"><strong data-start=\"9956\" data-end=\"9968\">Retirees</strong>who favor wellness facilities (<strong data-start=\"10000\" data-end=\"10052\">spa, hamam, sauna, massage rooms, relaxing rooms</strong>) and calm surroundings</p></li><li data-start=\"10078\" data-end=\"10192\"><p data-start=\"10080\" data-end=\"10192\"><strong data-start=\"10080\" data-end=\"10106\">Activity-minded buyers</strong>who&rsquo;ll actually use<strong data-start=\"10127\" data-end=\"10168\">fitness, tennis, basketball, football</strong>, and<strong data-start=\"10174\" data-end=\"10192\">running tracks</strong></p></li></ul><h2 data-start=\"10194\" data-end=\"10253\">Answers to the Practical Questions You&rsquo;re Already Asking About properties in Alanya</h2><p data-start=\"10255\" data-end=\"10421\"><strong data-start=\"10255\" data-end=\"10304\">How do we get to the sea if it&rsquo;s 2.5 km away?</strong><br data-start=\"10304\" data-end=\"10307\" />With the<strong data-start=\"10316\" data-end=\"10340\">shuttle to the beach</strong>.

Here, the look stays<strong data-start=\"11312\" data-end=\"11332\">clean and modern</strong>: light neutrals, blue accents, minimal patterns, and carefully chosen lighting. For instance, the main fixtures offer clarity without glare, while side lamps add softness for evenings. Because the kitchen uses timeless materials, you&rsquo;re not decorating against a trend; you&rsquo;re complementing a neutral stage. Add a few personal pieces and you&rsquo;re finished.</p><p data-start=\"11688\" data-end=\"11922\">The<strong data-start=\"11692\" data-end=\"11703\">balcony</strong>composition is the design&rsquo;s exclamation point.

Just<strong>50 meters from the sea</strong>, this 90 m&sup2; apartment features two balconies, two sleeping rooms, and an open-plan living area&mdash;ideal for those seeking both comfort and functionality.</p><p>Moreover, the property comes fully furnished and is situated within a residential complex offering a swimming pool, open parking, and security infrastructure. Whether you plan to live year-round or invest in a rental property with high demand, this unit provides exceptional value.</p><h2>Property Features and Interior Design</h2><p>The apartment offers a smart and spacious layout designed for daily convenience and coastal enjoyment. It includes two bright bedrooms, one bathroom with WC, a stylish American kitchen, and two wide balconies with views of the sea, pool, and surrounding landscape.</p><h3>Key Apartment Details:</h3><ul><li><p>Total area: 90 m&sup2;</p></li><li><p>Room layout: 2 sleeping rooms + living room with open kitchen</p></li><li><p>Condition: Fully furnished</p></li><li><p>Balcony: 2 large balconies, one with barbecue setup</p></li><li><p>Floor: Mid-level with sea and city views</p></li><li><p>Orientation: West and south-facing windows for natural light</p></li><li><p>Cooling: Air conditioning in main living and sleeping areas</p></li><li><p>Appliances: Fridge, built-in oven, stovetop, extractor fan, washing machine</p></li><li><p>Extras: Electric water heater, white goods included</p></li></ul><p>In addition, the apartment&rsquo;s open-plan concept and modern neutral tones contribute to a clean, airy atmosphere that enhances daily living.</p><h2>Interior Overview &ndash; Comfortable, Bright, and Ready to Enjoy</h2><h3>Living Room &amp; Dining Area</h3><p>The main living space welcomes you with soft beiges, polished ceramic floors, and contemporary ceiling lighting. A brown-toned sofa set and matching armchairs create a cozy sitting area. A round glass dining table with modern chairs adds elegance, while sliding doors open to the sea-facing balcony&mdash;perfect for relaxing or entertaining.</p><h3>Kitchen</h3><p>Visually connected to the living area, the American kitchen features warm-toned cabinetry, granite countertops, and modern white goods. The layout supports easy food prep while maintaining contact with guests in the living area. Storage and lighting are both thoughtfully arranged.</p><h3>Bedrooms</h3><p>Both sleeping rooms continue the airy theme. One includes a double bed with modern headboard, the other functions well as a guest or child&rsquo;s room. Neutral color palettes, large windows, and balcony access ensure restful energy throughout the space. Each room is equipped with blackout curtains and air conditioning.</p><h3>Bathroom</h3><p>The bathroom is stylishly tiled and includes a modern vanity with granite counter, under-sink storage, wall-mounted mirror cabinet, and a black-framed glass shower cabin. Subtle design touches, such as accent tiles behind the toilet, give the room a polished look.</p><h3>Balconies</h3><p>There are two balconies&mdash;one offers sea and pool views with outdoor dining setup, the other offers a quieter space with rattan chairs. Both are wide enough to enjoy daily use and add valuable living area to the apartment.</p><h2>Residential Site Features</h2><p>The apartment belongs to a well-managed residential complex offering:</p><ul><li><p>Outdoor swimming pool</p></li><li><p>Open-air parking area</p></li><li><p>24/7 camera security system</p></li><li><p>Cable TV and central satellite</p></li><li><p>Barbecue area</p></li><li><p>Green garden and landscaped paths</p></li><li><p>Near public transport and local shops</p></li></ul><p>Furthermore, site caretakers ensure maintenance and upkeep of shared areas, providing convenience and peace of mind to all residents.</p><h2>Life in Mahmutlar &ndash; Where Everyday Comfort Meets Investment Value</h2><p><strong>Mahmutlar</strong>is one of Alanya&rsquo;s most established neighborhoods, known for its spacious layout, green surroundings, and international resident base.

Built in<strong data-start=\"459\" data-end=\"467\">2020</strong>and set<strong data-start=\"476\" data-end=\"498\">550 m from the sea</strong>, the complex offers a practical resort-style setup with full on-site amenities. The apartment itself measures<strong data-start=\"609\" data-end=\"618\">75 m&sup2;</strong>, which is<strong data-start=\"629\" data-end=\"670\">larger than many peers in its segment</strong>, and it follows a<strong data-start=\"689\" data-end=\"706\">2 room layout</strong>: a living area with open (American) kitchen and one bedroom, supported by a comfortable plan that suits both holiday use and longer stays.</p><h2 data-start=\"847\" data-end=\"894\">Floor plan and flow &mdash; practical daily living</h2><p data-start=\"895\" data-end=\"1415\">The living room and open kitchen form one integrated space, so everyday routines feel simple and connected. You cook, host, watch a movie, and step out to the<strong data-start=\"1054\" data-end=\"1070\">wide balcony</strong>without breaking the conversation. Consequently, the apartment works well for couples or single residents who prefer an easy, low-maintenance layout that still feels spacious. Meanwhile, the single bedroom gives you a calm private corner, and the overall 75 m&sup2; footprint lets furniture breathe rather than forcing everything into tight corners.</p><h2 data-start=\"1417\" data-end=\"1468\">Interior design &mdash; modern and classic, harmonized</h2><p data-start=\"1469\" data-end=\"1598\">This home stands out because it blends<strong data-start=\"1508\" data-end=\"1536\">classic and contemporary</strong>notes in a way that feels intentional rather than improvised.</p><ul data-start=\"1600\" data-end=\"2732\"><li data-start=\"1600\" data-end=\"1928\"><p data-start=\"1602\" data-end=\"1928\"><strong data-start=\"1602\" data-end=\"1618\">Living area:</strong>Warm<strong data-start=\"1624\" data-end=\"1639\">brown tones</strong>on the furniture echo a<strong data-start=\"1664\" data-end=\"1689\">Chesterfield-inspired</strong>look, offering a touch of classic elegance. In contrast, a<strong data-start=\"1749\" data-end=\"1796\">retro-patterned rug and curated accessories</strong>add color and personality, so the room avoids becoming too formal. The result is a living space that feels both dressed and lively.</p></li><li data-start=\"1929\" data-end=\"2155\"><p data-start=\"1931\" data-end=\"2155\"><strong data-start=\"1931\" data-end=\"1943\">Kitchen:</strong><strong data-start=\"1944\" data-end=\"1975\">Glossy white cabinet fronts</strong>pair with a<strong data-start=\"1988\" data-end=\"2022\">black, mosaic-style backsplash</strong>, creating a sharp modern contrast.

Hotels and older developments dominate the shoreline, while new projects usually rise several streets away. Yet here is a home that breaks the pattern: a<strong>3 room, 100 m&sup2; apartment just 100 meters from the water</strong>, fully furnished and ready to move in.</p><p>For anyone searching for a property that balances convenience, comfort, and investment sense, this apartment represents a chance to claim both lifestyle and value in one of Alanya&rsquo;s most desirable areas.</p><h2>Interiors Prepared for Effortless Living</h2><p>Stepping inside, the first impression is ease. The apartment comes fully furnished, including all essential white goods, which means new owners can settle in immediately without the hassle of furnishing from scratch.</p><p>The living room forms the heart of the home, offering a bright and welcoming space large enough for family gatherings or relaxed evenings. Two bedrooms complete the layout, each with proportions suitable for long-term living or guest accommodation.</p><p>The presence of an<strong>electric water heater</strong>ensures modern practicality, while neutral finishes provide a versatile backdrop that adapts easily to different d&eacute;cor styles. Whether furnished for a family, a couple, or as a rental unit, the apartment offers flexibility and immediate usability.</p><h2>Complex Features That Add Everyday Value</h2><p>Beyond the apartment itself, the residential complex enhances daily life through a mix of social and practical facilities.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Swimming Pool</strong>&ndash; A refreshing retreat during Alanya&rsquo;s warm summers, right within the complex.</p></li><li><p><strong>Barbecue Area</strong>&ndash; Perfect for weekend gatherings and informal socializing with neighbors.</p></li><li><p><strong>24/7 Camera Systems and Caretaker Services</strong>&ndash; Security and order are maintained around the clock.</p></li><li><p><strong>Parking Spaces</strong>&ndash; A key convenience for residents with vehicles.</p></li></ul><p>These features transform the property from a simple living space into a lifestyle setting. For families, retirees, or tenants, such amenities create an environment where comfort and safety are a given.</p><h2>Oba &ndash; A Neighborhood Where Life Flows Smoothly</h2><p>This apartment&rsquo;s location is not just close to the sea; it is embedded in one of Alanya&rsquo;s most practical and enjoyable neighborhoods.</p><p>Oba is celebrated for its wide sandy beach and pedestrian-friendly promenade lined with palm trees. Here, residents enjoy the freedom to walk or cycle along the coast, stop at a caf&eacute;, or explore weekly street markets that bring the energy of a bazaar into everyday life. Mondays and Thursdays host these colorful markets, where everything from fresh fruit and vegetables to clothing and cosmetics can be found.</p><p>Moreover, Oba&rsquo;s transport links are exceptionally strong. Nearly every bus line connecting Alanya&rsquo;s neighborhoods passes through Oba, making it effortless to reach the city center or nearby areas like Tosmur, Kestel, and Mahmutlar. Essential services are also at hand, including supermarkets, restaurants of every variety, and Alanya Training and Research Hospital, which is located right in Oba.</p><p>In short, living here means combining seaside leisure with practical convenience in a way few other areas manage.</p><h2>Who Will Find This Apartment Ideal?</h2><h3>Families</h3><p>The 3 room layout (2 bedrooms + 1 living room) suits small families who want a home by the sea. Proximity to schools, parks, and the hospital adds reassurance, while the beach just steps away makes family outings effortless.</p><h3>Investors</h3><p>With Oba&rsquo;s popularity among both locals and foreigners, rental demand is strong year-round. Holiday visitors value the beach access, while long-term tenants seek Oba&rsquo;s practicality. Consequently, this apartment offers<strong>high rental potential</strong>in both markets.</p><h3>Retirees and Expats</h3><p>For those seeking a peaceful yet connected life by the sea, Oba provides everything needed &mdash; healthcare, social opportunities, markets, and reliable transport. The apartment&rsquo;s fully furnished condition makes the transition simple.</p><h3>Young Professionals and Digital Nomads</h3><p>Close to caf&eacute;s, restaurants, and the city center, this property also appeals to professionals working remotely. Reliable infrastructure and a vibrant local community combine with the calming proximity of the sea.</p><h2>Investment Perspective &ndash; Why This Apartment Holds Value</h2><p>Properties only 100 meters from the sea are rare in Oba, and this scarcity secures long-term value. When combined with the apartment&rsquo;s<strong>ready-to-move condition</strong>, furnished status, and on-site amenities, it becomes a particularly attractive rental property.</p><p>Buyers also benefit from potential discounts with cash payments, further increasing the financial appeal. With Alanya&rsquo;s property values consistently rising and demand from international buyers growing, this apartment offers security for today and growth for tomorrow.</p><h2>Choosing a Partner You Can Trust</h2><p>Buying property abroad requires more than a good listing &mdash; it demands guidance, clarity, and after-sales support. That is where Luxury Estate Turkey distinguishes itself.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Clear Guidance from Start to Finish</strong>&ndash; From your first inquiry to receiving the keys, every step is explained and managed with transparency.</p></li><li><p><strong>Market Expertise</strong>&ndash; Years of experience in Alanya&rsquo;s real estate landscape allow us to match buyers with properties that truly fit their goals.</p></li><li><p><strong>Legal and Residency Support</strong>&ndash; We help navigate paperwork, residence permit applications, and legal procedures with confidence.</p></li><li><p><strong>Tailored Service</strong>&ndash; Whether your priority is investment, family living, or a holiday home, we align our recommendations with your vision.</p></li><li><p><strong>Ongoing Support</strong>&ndash; After purchase, we remain available for property management, rental assistance, and resale advice.</p></li></ul><p>For international buyers, we also arrange inspection trips &mdash; giving you the chance to experience Oba and view properties in person before making your decision.</p><p>This 3 room, 100 m&sup2; apartment in Oba combines seafront proximity with practical amenities, offering both lifestyle comfort and investment potential.</p><p><strong>Are you ready to live just 100 meters from the Mediterranean?

    "property_description": "<div><h2>Furnished 3 Room Apartment for Sale in Mahmutlar &ndash; 115 m&sup2; with Separate Kitchen and Family-Oriented Design</h2><p>If you are searching for a spacious and well-planned<strong>apartment for sale in Alanya Mahmutlar</strong>, this 115 m&sup2; furnished flat offers a perfect blend of comfort, functionality, and warm interior touches. With a separate kitchen, a fully enclosed balcony, and a classical yet cozy decoration style, the property suits families, long-term residents, and investors who want a ready-to-move option in one of Alanya&rsquo;s most popular districts.</p><h2>Mahmutlar &ndash; A Balanced District Between Local Living and Tourism</h2><p>Mahmutlar is a district that stretches along the Mediterranean coastline, framed by sandy beaches on one side and the foothills of the Taurus Mountains on the other. This duality gives the neighborhood a distinctive atmosphere: the calm of nature meets the vibrancy of a modern residential town. Located only 10 km from Alanya city center, Mahmutlar combines everyday convenience with a holiday spirit.</p><p>Moreover, the district has developed into an expat-friendly community where international residents live side by side with locals. You will find foreign-owned cafes, family-run Turkish restaurants, and international chains all within walking distance. Salı Pazarı (the Tuesday market) is a highlight, offering fresh fruits, vegetables, spices, and traditional textiles every week.</p><p>Transportation is easy and frequent. Local minibuses circulate within Mahmutlar and towards Kargıcak, while buses to Alanya center depart every 10 minutes. Taxis are readily available on every corner. For shopping, residents enjoy Yekta Mall and Akdeniz Park shopping centers, while small butchers, bakeries, and hardware stores cover daily needs across the district.</p><p>Furthermore, Mahmutlar offers a lifestyle tailored to both leisure and activity. The beachfront is perfect for swimming and water sports, while the mountains at the back invite you for hiking, cycling, or weekend picnics. Fitness centers, hamams, and yoga studios add to the variety, making the area equally suitable for retirees, digital nomads, and families with children.</p><h2>Apartment Layout &ndash; Spacious, Functional, and Full of Light</h2><p>This<strong>3 room apartment in Mahmutlar</strong>spans 115 m&sup2;, which provides a larger footprint than the typical properties in the area. The layout emphasizes family living with clearly defined zones:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Living Room:</strong>A welcoming space decorated with beige and brown sofas arranged in a comfortable, family-friendly setup. A glass-topped coffee table with golden details adds elegance, while the TV unit, combining white and wood, creates a practical focal point. The yellow accent wall not only brings warmth but also balances the neutral tones of the furniture.</p></li><li><p><strong>Kitchen:</strong>Unlike many newer builds, this property comes with a separate kitchen&mdash;an advantage for buyers who prefer to keep cooking and living spaces apart. Cabinets combine classical brown frames with white doors, while the marble-effect countertop ensures durability and style. Decorative textiles and small details give the kitchen a homely atmosphere.</p></li><li><p><strong>Bedrooms:</strong>The master bedroom follows a calm pastel palette, with a classical bedframe, matching headboard, and nightstands. The second bedroom is arranged more minimally with a single bed and white furniture, making it suitable for a child, guest, or even a home office setup.</p></li><li><p><strong>Balcony:</strong>A highlight of this apartment is the large enclosed balcony. Glazed from floor to ceiling, it can be used year-round as a winter garden. Currently arranged with a swing, sofa, and table, the balcony doubles as an extra living area where families can enjoy tea in the evenings or quiet breakfasts on sunny mornings.</p></li></ul><p>In total, the design combines traditional comfort with modern practicality.

In this neighborhood, the sea, the city, and the lifestyle all come together.</p><p>Believe us, Cleopatra Beach was not named after Cleopatra for nothing!
