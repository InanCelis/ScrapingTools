It's next to the Royal Apollonia Hotel, indicating a prime and desirable location. One of the most appealing aspects of this apartment is its direct sea view. Residents can enjoy breathtaking views of the Mediterranean Sea from the comfort of their home. The complex is gated, which adds an extra layer of security and privacy for residents. The presence of a swimming pool within the complex is a fantastic amenity, allowing residents to relax and enjoy the water without leaving the premises. The apartment features three bedrooms, providing ample space for a family or guests. The master bedroom includes an en-suite bathroom, offering added convenience and privacy for the occupants. In addition to the en-suite bathroom, there is a family bathroom to serve the other bedrooms and guests. A spacious living room provides a comfortable area for relaxation and entertainment. The separate large kitchen is a great feature for those who enjoy cooking or need extra space for meal preparation. The technical balcony off the kitchen may offer additional utility space. Having a designated parking space is valuable, especially in a popular tourist area where parking can be challenging. The apartment has been fully renovated, which means it has updated electrical systems, plumbing, water tank, and solar panel. Additionally, the thermal aluminum windows help with insulation and energy efficiency, making the apartment more comfortable and cost-effective to maintain.</p>",
