The village is at the top of the hill (250 m above sea level) with a marvellous view of the coastline. A walk in the park will give aesthetic pleasure and will, at the same time, be educational. Here you will make an excursion into the history of Cyprus at the stations depicting handicrafts of the villagers in the past and nowadays. A specially positioned information board will show a flora and fauna map of Cyprus. Your kids may play at the playgrounds, and after that, the whole family may go to the lake to enjoy the shade of the trees around. Your pets may walk together with you, and nobody will ever reproach you for damaging the ecology - there isa dog toilet here.&nbsp;</p>",

The master bedroom has its own covered terrace with glass balustrades offering stunning views of the sea and surrounding area.
