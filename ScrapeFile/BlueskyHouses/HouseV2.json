This luxury project consists of 9 two-story independent villas with 3 bedrooms and a private pool each, located within a convenient 5-mins walking distance from the nearest beach. Throughout, the view enhances those stunning villas, but it is the interior bespoke design that reflects the ambience of those views. The concept of the floor plan design capitalizes on the astounding sea views, and its modern aesthetic honors the natural surrounding elements with the use of generous glazing that allows natural sunlight into the home. The interior of each villa is organized into two levels. On the ground floor, there is the main living area with large floor-to-ceiling windows, a well-equipped open space kitchen, and a welcoming dining area. The three bedrooms with en suite bathrooms are spread on the ground and first floors. The en-suite dressing room and walking closet add a touch of luxury and serve the modern needs for functionality and comfort. To make this project even more impressive, the exterior areas are dominated by the imposing spacious pool surrounded by sunbeds and sitting and dining areas that offer the feeling of enjoyment and relaxation throughout the day and the night.</p>",

The location enjoys a cooler microclimate than coastal Pafos with reduced humidity levels, due to its altitude and its natural environment. Despite its proximity to Pafos (a mere 5-minute drive to the town centre), the site enjoys a level of privacy and access to nature that is most often associated with more remote, mountainous locations. The residence is located to the northeast of Konia, and sits at an even higher altitude than the community. The residence enjoys direct and convenient access to neighbouring communities for local amenities such as bakeries, groceries, tavernas, and schools. The location also provides excellent access to the motorway directly from the roundabout at the entrance of Pafos. Therefore, it is easy to access the Paphos centre, the General Hospital, and the International Airport. There is a variety of activities to be enjoyed within a 10km radius. It consists of three levels, arranged to work with the topography for easy access, security, and sustainability. Its unique architecture is inspired by the site itself, and follows the architects&rsquo; aesthetic and environmental values to provide for a lifestyle that is at once luxurious and leisurely. The site is configured in such a way as to make the most of the sweeping views over Pafos, and at the same time utilise the topography and gradient to provide convenient and secure access. The placement of the residence allows a large garden to the front, and maintains a large part of the plot to the rear for additional landscaping to create a more private garden.</p>",

    "property_description": "<p>Nestled on the hillside outside of Kritou Terra, the house welcomes owners with a narrow passage adorned with flower pots, aromatic plants and the sounds from a trickling water fountain, setting a tone of warmth and serenity from your first step into this mountain paradise. The layout of the property is a masterful blend of functionality and beauty. Paved paths carved into the mountain stone and lined with fruit trees, aromatic plants, shrubs, and flowers lead visitors through the large terraced garden. This is a one of a kind estate for those wanting to get back to nature in style and comfort. Comprised of four levels and three houses, stone steps descend from the highest point of the property where the tower stands to the exquisitely designed lap pool on the second level. The third level is home to the main building&mdash; a three-story structure housing the master bedroom, living rooms, kitchen, dining area, bathrooms, guest room and service rooms. The fourth level is on the lower section of the property where the third building houses a large office, sun room, outdoor deck for afternoon cocktails and two guest bedrooms. The tower, standing 20 meters tall at the entrance, flanks the driveway, carport and garage and is the highest point of the property. It is a home to three bedrooms and two bathrooms with ancient imported Nepali doors and brass chandeliers evoking an atmosphere of peace in medieval times. A sitting room on the top floor offers spectacular views of the Mediterranean Sea and sand beaches between Polis and Pomos, a twenty-minute drive away. All rooms of the tower provide a secluded retreat, sweeping views of the surrounding countryside. Descending a series of stone stairs carved into the mountainside, you find the exquisitely designed swimming pool, nestled to the right offering a tranquil refuge to swim laps, rinse in a hidden outdoor shower and lounge under the tall pine trees within the calming aroma of rosemary, lavender and lemon verbena. Further down the winding stairs leads you to the main house on the third level. Upon entering the main house, the entrance hall serves as the central hub, connecting the various spaces of the ground floor. From here, you can walk toward the dining room and kitchen on one side, or the living room on the other. Indian furniture and Persian carpets fill the room with an exotic flair. Beneath the staircase leading to the master bedroom, a piano imported from Boston, Massachusetts graces the space, adding an air of elegance and old-world charm. French windows open from all rooms on this level onto a large terrace perfect for entertaining or hosting social gatherings. Beautiful greenish- grey slate tiles run throughout all rooms connecting spaces in a distinct harmony.</p>",

    "property_description": "<p>We are delighted to bring to the market for the first time a recently totally renovated 4 bedroom frontline golf villa. The works were completed in 2020, when the villa was stripped down to its bare structure and enlarged and reconstructed with replacement pipework, sanitary installations and electric wiring. Underfloor heating was installed throughout the villa together with a photovoltaic panel installation producing 12000kwh per annum. Maintenance free aluminium doors and windows with fly screens were fitted throughout the villa and the building was completely insulated in order to meet the latest EU energy and environmental ecological standards. The air conditioning units are all of the latest inverter type as is the Fairchild heat exchanger for heating the swimming pool. The swimming pool has a solid electric cover and uses the latest ioniser technology to soften the water and reduce chlorine consumption. The domestic water is also softened. The original Thalia designed bungalow was enlarged to form an internal size of 212 sqm on a plot of 1580 sqm with 45 sqm of covered terrace together with a removable pergola for extra shading. All planning approvals were completed and approved by the relevant authorities.</p>",

    "property_description": "<p>An opportunity to acquire a stunning four bedroom villa with light, modern interiors and wonderful outdoor space which includes a private infinity edge pool and a pagoda that offers breathtaking views over neighbouring Secret Valley Golf Course. The outside space has recently been renovated and now boasts a brand new built-in BBQ area, a hot tub, and a wooden pagoda that stretches out of the garden, offering a really great space from which to enjoy sundowner drinks or chill-out time in the shade of the day. The views from the pool and the pagoda are some of the best on the resort, reaching right over the remarkable Secret Valley golf course out to sea. The surrounding area is very peaceful and there is a wonderful feeling of tranquillity as you soak up the views. These views are not lost inside; the bright, modern interiors also have large windows through which the views pour in. All four of the bedrooms are en-suite: three of the bedrooms are situated on the ground floor and one in the cooler basement level. The spacious master double bedroom has an ensuite with spa bath and overhead shower, as well as a walk-in shower unit. This room shares a balcony with the second double bedroom (which is en-suite with walk-in shower) on this level, overlooking Secret Valley. The third of the rooms on this level, the twin room, has a private balcony and en-suite bathroom with walk-in shower. Downstairs hosts the well equipped family kitchen, and beautiful dining area with stairs leading down to the large living space. The living area is a tall, open space with a real sociable feel. The patio doors that run the length of the living area open up to the upper outside terrace where there is comfortable seating and a dining table and chairs. The views from the terrace and living area are stunning. There is air-conditioning units and central heating. Downstairs, in the cooler basement level, you will find a lovely double room, which opens out to the lower terrace and lawn. This room also has an en-suite bathroom, with a walk-in shower.</p>",

    "property_description": "<p>A four-bedroom three-storey house with entry at the top level. The car entrance is from the road level, and a parking area is at the top enclosed with vertical louvers. Cantilevered verandas and a swimming pool extend towards the view to the south. The project site is located on a hillside with a steep drop down from road level. Aside from the challenge, the topography affords panoramic views to the sea.<br />The central concept is the configuration of spaces vertically, taking advantage of the morphology of the site for access, privacy and views. Car access and parking is from street level, with the house unraveling in three levels below, with privacy increasing towards the bottom.<br />The kitchen, living and dining spaces have access to a swimming pool and terrace, both of which cantilever out of the cliff to the horizon. Secondary functions like storage and bathrooms are located at the deepest part of the plan at each level. The individual volumes of each story, the parking, the verandas and the swimming pool are outlined clearly from below, whilst from the street the residence has a discreet presence of a single story. The parking is covered but open, with vertical timber louvers for shading and security. Looking at the residence from below, the form seems even more dramatic thanks to the extensive use of fair-face concrete. Large concrete building volumes appear to float from the hill side, creating an unexpected composition that appears to defy gravity. The building is half-submerged in the earth, using the soil to further insulate the interior. The thermal mass from the cliff means the house stays cool during the summer and warm in the winter. Large south facing windows were mandatory to make the most of the views, and the use of louvers and overhangs controls passive solar gains depending on the season.<br />The building envelope is constructed and insulated to a high standard, to enhance the building's environmental performance, and all active systems as well as lighting and appliances used were selected for their efficiency.<br />The property has Title Deeds<br />Tala Village is about 8 kilometres north of Paphos. In the Northeast of the village is the Agios Neophytos monastery and the amphitheater . In the south of the village its' neighboring village is Emba and from there also Paphos town. Tala's first residents date back to the late 1800's with a population of only 276, in 2001 permanent residents numbered 2540. Tala has become popular with many expats due to the stunning views many of the properties there offer as well as the proximity to Paphos town. It is really a prime location as all areas of Paphos are easily accessed from Tala.</p>",

    "property_description": "<p>The development was designed so it would complement and be complemented by the immediate surroundings. The development is at the top of a small canyon with one of the properties accessed via a road that leads down into the canyon to a lower-level plot. The area is mainly scrub, grassland and trees with areas of open cream or white limestone. The development follows the pattern of the landscape in being planted with mature trees and with a garden that blends with the natural vegetation. The soft natural colours of the exterior, highlighted and yet softened by the use of terracotta screens and natural wood panelling lead seamlessly into the interior living space and transition through a spacious outdoor living area. The exterior colour scheme and use of wood is continued inside with soft sand-coloured walls and ceilings highlighted with walnut doors and soft, warm downlighters that are unobtrusive yet effective in producing a homely feel during the winter nights. Internally, the feeling of luxury is highlighted with travertine marble panels used in the bathrooms and as a headboard for the bedrooms. As well as being a luxurious touch, marble is renowned for its cool touch and helps reduce the temperature as you sleep. Walnut finish doors are fitted to each room as well as the closets. In places, walnut panelling is added as a feature and adds to the feel of bringing the outside in, mirroring the exterior finishing touches. High-quality marble tiles adorn the floor throughout the properties whilst Italian-designed and manufactured ceramic tiles are used above the granite work surfaces in the kitchen, in complementary shades. The kitchen is fitted with high-spec cabinets and electrical appliances from top European manufacturers. Finally, the landscaping of the project has been carefully considered so the mature tree planting is in tune with the naturally occurring greenery. Smaller shrubs also reflect the environment, chosen from species endemic to Cyprus. For ease of maintenance, an automatic watering system is in place and for sustainability, a lining and gravel cover the ground to reduce water loss through evaporation.</p>",

    "property_title": "Detached Villa FOR SALE in Paphos, Kouklia - Aphrodite Hills",
    "property_description": "<p>This is a totally unique opportunity to purchase what is undoubtedly one of the finest properties on the whole of Aphrodite Hills, which backs directly onto the 4th Fairway of the Aphrodite Hills PGA Golf Course. This magnificent Villa was constructed on a double plot in 2008 and is approached via a spacious, gated driveway set in beautiful gardens, and right from the outset one is totally encapsulated by its sheer beauty. Upon entering the villa you are greeted with the bright, stylish dining room with concertina doors that run the length of the room, offering an instant, beautiful view out to the wonderful outside terrace, pool, garden and golf course beyond. The glass dining room sits between the main living area &amp; kitchen/diner, and the first of the five luxurious bedrooms. The open plan living area and kitchen/diner is both modern, inviting and comfortable; with a floating kitchen bar and stools, this area is the social hub of the ground floor. There is a second side kitchen with its own sink, two dishwashers and second fridge/freezer &ndash; making entertaining even easier. This whole room also overlooks the outside area, with large patio doors that provide plenty of natural light and beautiful views. The Villa&rsquo;s large outside space is well thought out, beautifully landscaped and boasts the best private pool on the resort &ndash; an impressive 25 x 5 metre pool with roman steps entrance to one end, and marble bar stools to the other. Outside areas do not come better &ndash; as well as the pool you will find a large jacuzzi, a large astro turfed lawn (with views on to the golf course) perfect for sunbathing, a stylish dining area set by the pool perfect for enjoying al fresco meals, a built in gas BBQ, and a shaded terrace with plenty of seating areas to make the most of. The jacuzzi has its own sound system (that you can connect to your phone, and radio stations) that provides the outside area with music. The space and facilities have been perfectly designed to keep everyone entertained and happy all year round in the Cyprus tradition. The ground floor double room also has patio doors which offer views over the pool and garden, continuing the light atmosphere throughout the whole level. This room benefits from having a large screen TV, ceiling fan, a walk through wardrobe space with large mirrors lead into the room&rsquo;s en-suite bathroom which boasts a large walk-in shower. Also on the same floor, but with its own separate entrance from the main villa, is the second double bedroom; this can be accessed by a separate front door, or via the outside terrace patio doors to the rear. This self-contained double room also has plenty of wardrobe space, a TV, ceiling fan and en-suite bathroom with bath and overhead shower. Stairs from the ground floor lead up to the stunning first floor seating area. The height of opulence, this room is dressed in marble, and is beautifully decorated and, thankfully, with no sign of a TV &ndash; this area is meant for pure relaxation, and for soaking up the views that spill into the room through the full length concertina doors that open up the whole room and give it the impression of basking in an outside terrace. This area is perfect for letting go of all the stresses of life with a good book, escaping the rest of the family while they make use of the fantastic outside space, or enjoying a glass of champagne as the sun sets, and the garden lights up. The impressive master bedroom is set to one side of this sitting area: with a separate walk-in wardrobe with full length mirror doors; a separate en-suite with a large walk-in shower, his and hers sinks; a private balcony which overlooks the pool and garden; patio doors that offer views over the pool and garden. The last two bedrooms, one double and one twin, are set off to the other side of the sitting area: a lockable door means that they can be treated as their own annex. The twin room has two interconnecting doors to the double room, and the rooms share a bathroom with a large walk-in shower. Both rooms have patio doors that open out to offer views over the pool and garden and have large screen TVs. The beautiful double room also benefits from having a ceiling fan. Venture up one more floor and you will find the spacious top floor outside terrace which offers the same wonderful view of the pool, garden, golf course and mountains but from a higher perspective and more peaceful outlook. The interior of the property is fully air-conditioned throughout with ceiling fans, and there is underfloor heating for all year round comfort.</p>",

    "property_title": "Detached Villa FOR SALE in Paphos, Pegia - Coral Bay",
    "property_description": "<p>Exclusive custom-designed villa, built to the highest standards, guaranteeing maximal comfort and luxury living. Stunning panoramic views are delivered in the comfort of this beautiful privately gated home. Perched on a hill, you have a bird&rsquo;s eye view, stretching from all along the coast of Paphos to Akamas Bay. Each room delivers a view where you can take in the beautiful surroundings and sea views! This villa features 6 bedrooms plus an office/cinema room, 9 bathrooms, large spacious two living areas, and two dining areas in a 730sq.m internal living space. Offering you luxurious natural finishes throughout: top-spec tiles, worktops, bespoke kitchen, elevator, false ceilings, and much more. The home flows beautifully on 3 levels allowing for the seamless transition between the indoors &amp; outside. The Master Suite is spacious and flows into the dreamy master bathroom hosting decadent extras such as double sinks and a walk-in shower! The master suite enjoys a walk-in closet and of course those breathtaking views. A stunning, large outdoor entertaining area treats you to a pool, BBQ, and outdoor shower. The mountain slope elevation of the plot has inspired this unique architectural concept. The design approach is focused on utilizing the two main characteristics of the site which are the wide-angle sea view and the naturally elevated terrain. The villa is positioned into the hilly site, blending with the natural landscape while its distinctive roof line visually extends the organic geometry of the landscape linking it to the waves of the bay ahead. The villa is structurally hinged into the rocky mountain allowing for the entire facade to be fully cantilevered towards the view. The resulting image of the hovering fully glazed facade, combined with the roof curves created a unique architectural statement of lightness and natural elegance. The entry atrium is designed to provide views of the coastline in front of the plot, forever altering its core appearance to match the surrounding bay and amazing views. The villa provides a large number of features that enhance its luxurious status and privacy. The access is controlled by two gated entrances, one entrance includes a water feature with jets positioned on both sides of the bridge that spans the distance between the garden and the entrance patio. The landscape design preserves most of the natural grey rock slope and is further enhanced with the use of boulder walls using identical display walls, an internal garden feature, wine cava, and a bar. The villa includes a contemporary design lift, a sauna, a home cinema/office space, and maids' quarters. The glazing system used allows for frameless glass corners that enable unobstructed views while maintaining the thermal and soundproofing of the internal areas. The whole of the ground floor and externally accessible entry openings at the 1st and 2nd floors are fitted with concealed r/c security shutters. The top floor and all externally accessible entry openings at the 1st and 2nd floors are fitted with concealed r/c security shutters. The top-floor bedroom ceilings are designed to provide a loft character, with a variable 4-meter average height and fully glazed upper windows. The spacious 6-bedroom plus office suite villa also provides the option of an entirely separated guest suite. The villa incorporates a 5KW photovoltaic system, concealed hoover system, concealed air conditioning, and an underfloor heating system.</p>",

    "property_description": "<p>This six bedroomed villa has simply everything, and sits in breathtaking surroundings with sea and golf course views in a quiet cul de sac on the Eastern Plateau. As one enters by the large elegant electric gates, you enter the large driveway which turns and leads down to the house forming a highly impressive entrance to Villa. Villa is beautifully designed, the outside area is vast, and offers fantastic golf and sea views that surround the villa, and the fittings and layout of the interiors make for a wonderful living space. Complimenting the stunning decor are the high ceilings and carefully designed lighting that offers a welcoming ambience, and every detail, from little to large, has been thoughtfully designed to ensure that owners will enjoy every aspect of the property and its location. The villa boasts six ensuite bedrooms, a ground floor living area, dining area and kitchen, basement level bar and living area, a gym, steam room, massage room and outside space with private pool, hot tub, BBQ area and pretty, lawned gardens. There is a spacious terrace facing down the ravine with magnificent views of the Mediterranean Sea &ndash; this view that can be enjoyed from the majority of rooms inside too. There is a 13 x 4.5 m private pool (with heating) that has submerged bar stools, and there is a sunken hot tub. There is a great barbeque area with a large gas BBQ and kitchen area &ndash; including dishwasher and ice machine:&nbsp; the perfect outdoor facilities to enjoy poolside al fresco dining with your friends and family. There is also a lovely lawned garden area, deliberately placed to face both sunrise and sunset &ndash; which is great for some outdoor yoga. The sound system in the villa reaches the outside terrace, so that you can listen to your favourite music in the Cypriot sunshine. The interiors have been designed with a mixture of glass and wooden features, high-raise ceilings and beautiful lighting features, creating a wonderful inside living space. The living area is open-plan and has a fireplace and large patio doors that open out to the pool terrace, bringing those magnificent views indoors. The dining area is next to the living area and leads on to the bright, modern kitchen that also faces the pool, making it a great social space that can be accessed from both the terrace and the BBQ area &ndash; so food preparation is straight forward and fun. The ground floor hosts two bedrooms, each with large modern en-suite bathrooms with showers. Both bedrooms open out onto the poolside terrace. The highlight of the villa is found downstairs! This super cool basement level is bright and open, and has a living area with a bar. This is also where you will find the gym, massage room, steam room, separate shower space, and a further two ensuite bedrooms (each bathroom with a modern shower ensuite). The gym and living space on this level open up to the lower outside terrace. Upstairs on the first floor, the bedrooms are incredible. First up is the huge master double bedroom, with en-suite bathroom that has a separate bath and shower unit. The bath offers a heavenly experience, with views from the large window that overlook the ravine and sea views. The second double room on this level also has an en-suite bathroom with separate bath (also with golf and sea views) and shower unit. The villa is also well fitted on a practical level &ndash; there is a laundry unit with washing machine and tumble dryer, high speed wi-fi throughout (internally and around the pool area for all portable devices), it has modern security, is air-conditioned throughout, has a fireplace in the living area, underfloor heating on the ground and first floor, and has central heating.</p>",
