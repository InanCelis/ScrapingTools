Whether you require an exciting holiday time with plenty of activities or just wish to lie back and relax while enjoying the crystal-clear sea and fine sand beaches, the area is a spot on. The location is in the heart of the area yet, neighboring with green spaces ensures calmness when needed. Privacy was one of the top priorities of the designing process, while the project includes just two unique three-bedroom, single floor apartments. Moreover, stylish living is a key theme for the Triangle as its design consists of clear lines, earth colors and open spaces. It stands out for its high aesthetic and contemporary outer and interior elements as aluminum louvers on each floor shift on the user&rsquo;s request. Individual entrance through controlled access provides the additional security needed for such a property. While the top apartment owns a private roof garden which includes a neat and carefully placed jacuzzi surrounded by a sun- lounge area, the ground floor apartment has uninterrupted access to the plot&rsquo;s garden areas. Elegantly decorated using high-end materials and construction elements, the project responds in the best possible way to the needs of the most demanding investors and buyers of the wider Protaras area. As with all Giovani homes, purchasers will have the benefit of being able to choose from an extensive range of high-quality interior finishes. The South East Coast areas&rsquo; of Cyprus have become a sought after destination for permanent living as well as for holiday making time in recent years. More specifically the Kapparis area, has gradually developed into a stunning coastal resort, which boast an array of restaurants, all year-round facilities and services.

Although it is just 2 miles (3 kilometers) from the main seafront tourist area, Paphos City Center or Ktima as it is known locally, feels a world away. Take a stroll around this charming and laid-back part of town to see elegant, colonial-era constructions and the modern commercial center of town. Ktima is the perfect antidote for people looking to escape the busier, livelier and more tourist-heavy district of Kato Paphos or Lower Paphos. Wander around the city center bars and traditional restaurants. Pause for a coffee in a caf&eacute; with a harbor view. While you&rsquo;re here, browse the edible goods on offer at the municipal market. The &ldquo;agora&rdquo; as the locals call it is where Paphos residents go to shop for groceries. With its many narrow lanes and its relatively small size, Paphos City Center is best explored on foot. If you don&rsquo;t want to walk uphill to get here, ride a local bus from the harbor instead.</p>",
