    "property_description": "<p>Upon leaving the private lift to enter this duplex penthouse a sense of excitement fills the air, in anticipation of what is to be revealed. This property is vast, colorful and an amalgamation of different influences, all vying for your attention.<br /><br />The main floor stretches out to reveal a stunning living room split into two - one ever so slightly more formal than its companion but equally as aristocratic. Both are visible through an elegant archway which creates a sense of continuum with each one vastly illuminated via expansive glass windows and doors that offer a glimpse of the colossal terrace that wraps itself around the residence. High ceilings with classical moldings frame each room and create a feeling of grandeur, whilst rich artwork adorns the walls.<br /><br />A separate dining area takes its place adjacent to the more formal of the two living rooms, quietly placed by terrace windows and kept company by a fireplace offering the promise of gentle warmth in the winter months.<br /><br />The kitchen is wide, open and welcoming, with is summery blue floor tiles caressing underfoot and mirroring the colours in the backsplash tiles along with walls.  Cupboard and storage space is plentiful thus leaving the countertops uncluttered whilst high end appliances feature throughout. Direct access is offered through glass terrace doors that frame the natural green areas outlining the view.<br /><br />The bedrooms are works of art…masterpieces in their own right, each one telling a different story to its guest but at the same time offering a baronial sanctuary in which to repose.  Colours and hues stand out in each room - earthy pinks,  warm claret, playful lavender and chic creams - all individual yet continuing the sensation of sophistication and nobility. Each bedroom features huge windows and terrace doors that allow swathes of natural light to flood in whilst offering a glimpse of the azure blue sky outside.<br /><br />All of the bedrooms reveal extensive walk through wardrobes yet it is the master suite on the uppermost floor that is the striking boudoir. Sumptuously sweeping across the top floor, it is lavishly appointed to take full advantage of a vast terrace that displays the swimming pool in all its glory, looking out across the treetops and over to the Mediterranean Sea.  The solarium rises upwards still further to a terrace covered by a palapa, spectacular with its vaulted thatched ceiling. Views from here are all encompassing, sweeping around from the mountains at the rear across to the blue horizon of the sea.<br /><br />Each bedroom enjoys the privacy and luxury of its ensuite bathroom, all glorious with their mosaic tiles in heavenly shades that complement the bedroom it serves.  From neutral palettes to warm blues each one is fully equipped with single or double sink units, walk in showers, bathtubs and vanity units.<br /><br />Yet, the most dazzling feature of this ravishing property is its seemingly boundless terrace that snakes around the residence offering ubiquitous views of the sea, mountain ranges and the perfectly kept gardens of the gated community that surround the communal pool.<br /><br />With just 28 neighbors, this beachside, highly sought after double-gated community offers 24 hour security, total privacy and tranquility yet is just minutes from the incredible beaches of Guadalmina Baja and only a stones throw from bars, first class restaurants, the marina and some of the finest golf course recognised along the coast.<br /><br />This property is a heady concoction of influences - from whimsical romanticisms to seductive Moorish fusions and Andalucian flair.  It will encourage you in, take you room to room in a sense of wonderment, and leave you realizing that you need look no further.<br /><br />This is the extraordinary place you can now call home.</p>",

    "property_description": "<p>In its prime position within one of the coasts most renowned gated communities, offering an alfresco gymnasium, Andalucian style walkways and passageways guiding you around the urbanization and with beautifully tended gardens and swimming pool, this is a leafy oasis unlike any other.<br /><br />Rising above its surroundings yet protected by the all embracing silhouette of the iconic La Concha mountain at the rear, this stunning penthouse is sublet yet elegant in both its position and its appearance.<br /><br /><br />Walking into the open plan living areas you are immediately taken aback by the sheer luminosity of the entire floor. Windows that appear to wrap around the facade of the property give huge glimpses of breathtaking views that steal your gaze from the mountain range, down to the coast and out across the glistening Mediterranean Sea where the deep blue borderline of the horizon meets the skies above.<br /><br />The dining room is elegant on one side of the main living area, streamlined in white and black neutral shades - a theme that continues over in the kitchen which stands adjacent. This kitchen has been astutely designed to run the length of the property yet offer bar seating area at one end.  The kitchen is fully equipped with a myriad of first class appliances, including a wine cooler, all cleverly integrated within the white units that sit juxtaposed to the black countertops. A glass door at one end gives direct access out onto the terrace that encircles the property.<br /><br />Delicately positioned in the main section of the floor is the seating area, frame again by the windows along the front of the property. Beautifully dressed in white, in keeping with the cleanliness of the decor, and with touches of pastel colour, this area gives a feeling of elegant ease. A chaise longue is ingeniously placed in the far corner adding a certain ‘je ne sais quoi’ to the ambience.  All throughout the touches of colour subliminally link each space to its neighbor, thus creating a graceful continuance.<br /><br />The hall leading off from the dining area reveals two dazzling bedrooms, each one a quiet corner offering reflection and tranquility. The guest bedroom is charming in it pastel pink and white furnishings, with mirrors skillfully positioned to reflect as much light as possible. The effect is glittering. Its adjoining bathroom is simplistically designed and uncluttered, offering a feeling of serenity to its guests.<br /><br />However, it is the master suite that is resplendent, both in size and illumination. Furnished in pure white with just a splash of vibrant colour here and there, this room commands your attention.  With the bed strategically placed to appreciate views through the windows and a colossal walk in wardrobe and dressing room at one end, this feels more like a separate wing to the property than a bedroom! The ensuite bathroom has an aura of chintzy chic to it, with its delicately flowered wall paper, yet is sleek in its modernity with a full length walk in shower at one end and two sink units side by side, all in pure white.<br /><br />The terrace that wraps around the property is open and wonderfully designed, with various seating and dining areas, all of which enjoy both sun and shade at different times of the day. The view across the tree tops and over to the sea are all encompassing as are the views back across to La Concha. Up yet further to the solarium floor is the roof top. This hidden secret offers promises of long lazy summer afternoons spent lounging under the summer sun or of evenings spent sipping cocktails and counting stars.<br /><br />With is exalted location on the Golden Mile this penthouse is simply stunning… a sanctuary yet still a home… a home that, once you are safely esconced within, you may never want to leave.  Perfect!</p>",

    "property_description": "<p>Penthouse Halcon presents a rare opportunity to enjoy sophisticated hillside living in one of Benahavís’ most desirable residential communities. Located within the secure and tranquil Torre Halcones development, this meticulously renovated duplex penthouse spans two floors and approximately 180 square meters of interior space, complemented by a generously sized terrace with sweeping panoramic views of the Mediterranean Sea, nearby golf courses, and the Sierra de las Nieves mountain range.<br /><br />The home includes three spacious bedrooms, each with en-suite bathrooms, and a stylish guest powder room that enhances the property’s functionality. Interior design emphasizes natural light, openness, and warmth, supported by southeast orientation and floor-to-ceiling Cortizo Slim windows and terrace doors—especially in the living room, where they fully slide to one side to create an expansive connection to the outdoors. Throughout the apartment, elegant wood flooring in chevron herringbone pattern lends timeless character, while all doors extend from floor to ceiling, enhancing the sense of height and volume in every room. Interior styling is refined yet comfortable, featuring furnishings from high-end design labels such as Bycrea and  Zoco Home.<br /><br />A custom-built Nordic design kitchen serves as a focal point of the home, crafted in warm walnut wood and fitted with Gaggenau and Smeg appliances for both beauty and performance. The kitchen’s seamless integration with the dining and living areas makes it ideal for both casual meals and formal gatherings. Every piece of carpentry within the apartment is bespoke and tailor-made, ensuring a refined, cohesive aesthetic throughout.<br /><br />The property is enhanced with premium details such as 15 integrated Sonos speakers—installed both inside and on the terraces—alongside smart Buster and Punch switches and sockets that reflect the attention to detail. In the bathrooms and guest toilet on the entry level, microcement finishes contribute to a clean, modern ambiance, while all mirrors feature bespoke tinted glass and each shower enclosure, including the master suite&apos;s double shower, incorporates unique designer glass partitions.<br /><br />The master suite is particularly impressive, offering 16 meters of custom wardrobe space, a Swedish hotel-grade bed measuring 210 cm, and a luxurious en-suite bathroom with a double hand shower and oversized rain shower. A hidden office and an additional 20-square-meter storage space provide practicality without compromising the aesthetics of the living space. All lighting is dimmable, and the apartment features underfloor heating in all bathrooms as well as a zoned Airzone climate control system for ultimate comfort.<br /><br />Outdoor living is just as thoughtfully designed. The terrace features Mykonos stone flooring, an outdoor kitchen, and a private mini plunge pool with heating, perfect for year-round enjoyment. This space provides a seamless extension of the interior and is ideal for entertaining or unwinding while enjoying unobstructed views of the coastline and mountains.<br /><br />Included with the property is a private garage space and a large additional storage room, completing the home’s offering of luxury and convenience.<br /><br />Set within the peaceful Monte Halcones community, residents benefit from a secure, low-density environment surrounded by Andalusian and Mediterranean architecture. The Monte Halcones Shopping Centre is just minutes away and offers restaurants, cafés, and daily amenities, while the nearby village of Benahavís is known for its culinary scene, featuring popular restaurants such as El Cordero and Los Abanicos.<br /><br />Recreational opportunities abound, with elite golf clubs like La Quinta and Los Arqueros nearby, and scenic hiking routes available around La Zagaleta and the Guadalmina River. Families will appreciate the proximity to international schools like Marbella Montessori and Laude San Pedro, while excellent road access via the AP-7 ensures quick connectivity to Puerto Banús, San Pedro, and Málaga Airport.<br /><br />Penthouse Halcon is not only a home but a complete lifestyle offering. With bespoke finishes, top-tier amenities, and a setting that balances serenity with convenience, it exemplifies modern luxury living in the hills of Benahavís.</p>",
