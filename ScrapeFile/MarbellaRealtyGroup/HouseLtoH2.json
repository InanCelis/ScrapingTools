Although the property is in good condition and perfectly habitable, it allows for some aesthetic updates to modernize, improve, and adapt it to personal preferences.<br /><br />The house is equipped with individual air conditioning units in several rooms and solar panels. While it does not have a garage, it is located on a private street with little traffic, making parking easy.

It is conveniently located in a peaceful yet well-populated area, equipped with all the necessary services for comfortable living.<br />At street level, there is a large parking area and an entrance hall with plenty of storage space.<br /><br />On the first floor, we find a spacious living room with a glazed terrace, perfect for making the most of the space and natural light. On this level, you&apos;ll find a newly renovated guest toilet, a charming, recently installed kitchen, a convenient utility room, and a large, private, cosy rear patio.<br />On the next level, we find the master bedroom en-suite, with its terrace, a large built-in wardrobe, and a newly renovated bathroom. On the other side of the staircase is the second bedroom, featuring a window, ample wardrobe space, and a well-maintained bathroom; it is also generously sized.<br />The attic floor, which was used as an office, offers more than enough space for a third bedroom. From the terrace on this level, there are lovely views over the area, with typical Mediterranean-style houses and plenty of greenery.<br /><br />The house is ready to move into, with furniture, TV and all English channels, although it also offers great potential for investment, renovation, or improvement, which is reflected in the price. Only fourteen homes are on this side of the community, all with charming front garden areas and a large swimming pool to the south of the row.<br /><br />The long-established Mar Golf community is ideally located, with the Terrazas de Miraflores Shopping Centre just around the corner. Very close by are The Miraflores Golf practice range and Clubhouse, the Miraflores Tennis & Paddle Club, and Riviera Beach, all less than a kilometre away. Additionally, in the lower Riviera area near the entrance and exit to the main road, a wide range of shops, bars, restaurants, and pharmacies are open all year.<br /></p>",

On the top floor, there is a spacious, open-plan attic, the former hayloft, offering the potential for more rooms and access to a terrace with spectacular views of the valley and the village.<br /><br />If you are looking for a large property or a business project in a tourist town like Ardales, known for the Caminito del Rey and the Gaitanes Natural Park, this house offers endless possibilities.</p>",

TRADITIONAL Spanish Environment<br />. Possible Rural Tourism Opportunity<br /><br />Built around the year 1500, this was either the 1st or the 2nd house of Guaro.<br />The rest of the village organically grew around it.<br /><br />Before that time, Guaro was a tiny village around a Moorish castle on the hills 3 kms further. The richest farmers settled far out of the village, against a hillside shielding them against the sun.<br />Possibly for the need of work force they erected a small church here too... and it is here that current day Guaro started to grow after the fall of the Moors.<br /><br />In 1614 Guaro was given the royal title of &apos;Villa&apos;. This was done by King Felipe IV of Spain. Such title was usually for a village that had shown exceptional courage or assistance in the Christian Reconquista on the Moors.<br />It was at this moment that Guaro became a County and a trusted statesman from Madrid, Don Juan Chumacero de Sotoymayor y Carrillo, was elevated to Count of Guaro.<br /><br />The water well on the patio still points to the magnificent history of the mansion, just as a room specifically dedicated to the curing of olives does.<br /><br />When the counts left the village, some 100 years ago, the house became the cradle of all members of a Guarenian family, most of whom were born or raised here.<br /><br />In the year 2000 the mansion was fully renovated.<br /><br />When you enter the main house, you instantly see the first, narrow patio in front of you as well as the larger patio behind it.<br />On the left you have a lounge and on the right a room that was last used as a bedroom. A kitchen, bathroom and an olive atelier make this first floor complete.<br />On the second floor there are 3 bedrooms (2 double, 1 single) and a bathroom.<br />On the third floor a spacious loft.<br /><br />The entrance to the guest apartment is on the side of the building.<br />The front door gives way to a staircase that leads to the 1st floor where this apartment is situated.<br />It exists of a kitchen, a lounge, 2 bedrooms and a bathroom.<br /><br />This apartment can be reconnected with the main house, by creating a staircase to the patio downstairs.<br /><br />Parking is in the street - and rather special for an Andalusian mountain village: it does not take much practise to drive to the property: there are no steep alleys.<br />It is in a fully flat part of the village, with grocery stores at a one minute walk, and bars at 3 minutes.<br />Guaro is a modest white village, located on the edge of the Sierra de las Nieves natural park. Thanks to its elevated position, at over 350 metres above sea level, the village offers privileged views across the surrounding countryside.<br /><br />The area is known for producing almonds and olives, which is an important part of the local economy. Guaro has it ́s own olive mill, where locals have their harvests pressed. It is the ideal spot for outdoor lovers, which also offers a few famous cultural activities like the Luna Mora festival in September. Like many white villages in Andalucia, the village dates back to the Arabic occupation of Spain.<br /><br /><br />Guaro is located 55 minutes (50 km) from the city of Málaga and the airport and the beaches of the Costa del Sol (Marbella) are only a 35 minute (24 km.) drive away!</p>",

Located in a small urbanisation of only 23 houses with a communal pool and gardens.<br /><br />A lovely large home with lots of space and storage, and located in a peaceful area, yet within walking distance of all amenities in Manilva Village.<br /><br />There is an entrance gate for cars and a pedestrian door to enter the property. You enter the property to a big courtyard with carport where you can fit at least three cars. From the terrace/courtyard, there are steps leading down to a basement and stairs leading up to the main house.<br /><br />Whilst officially a three-bedroom house, the present owners have built an extension that can be used as a fourth bedroom.<br /><br />As you enter the house there is a large spacious living/dining room with a split level. The living area has a wood-burning fire making it very cosy on winter evenings. There is air-conditioning in the lounge. There are two sets of double balcony doors leading out from here to the terrace. The terrace is a lovely area with an awning so that you have shaded and unshaded areas. A stunning spot to dine al fresco whilst soaking up the mountain air, and taking in the beautiful sea views. There is also a view of the communal pool. Tucked away in the corner is access to a utility room.<br /><br />The kitchen is a separate room but there is a sliding door that enables one to tuck the door away and give it more of an open-plan feel. The kitchen is fully fitted and has a double sink above which there is a large window with stunning views across to Casares village. Imagine doing the washing up whilst looking right out to the mystical mountains. Truly breathtaking.<br /><br />On this level, the owners have added an extension which is an office/small bedroom with an ensuite shower room and fitted wardrobes.<br /><br />The first floor is home to three bedrooms and one bathroom. All bedrooms have balcony doors, are bright, and have excellent views. The main bedroom has a walk-in wardrobe and a balcony, is south-facing and has stunning views of the sea and across to the vineyards and mountains. The second bedroom has fitted wardrobes, a Juliet balcony and also has amazing sea views. The family bathroom has been refurbished and is modern with a walk-in shower. Even from here, there are stunning mountain views to the mountain range, Sierra Bermeja. The third bedroom is a double bedroom with fitted wardrobes and a private terrace. The views are beautiful over the pool, across the vineyards and to the sea.<br /><br />The basement of this house is actually at ground level with natural light and makes up the whole footprint of the house. There is a toilet and the owners are using it as a gym and for storage. There are so many possibilities and different uses for this space. The owners have also built a storeroom under the stairs which is very useful.<br /><br />This is a fabulous house which would make the perfect family home. Whilst in a quiet residential area, you are within walking distance of the village, its restaurants, school, music school, sports complex, medical centre, banks etc. And whilst located in a white-washed village you are literally a 5-minute drive from the coast, giving you the best of both worlds. In 5 minutes you can be at the beach, in Marina de la Duquesa or in Sabinillas town.<br /><br />Come view with me!</p>",

It would, however, allow for a vertical extension to be built in, subject to the current regulations and building ratios.<br />Currently the house is built on 3 floors. The ground floor houses the living room, an unusually large kitchen with dining table and exit to a pantry/laundry room plus a full bathroom.<br />Upstairs we find 2 good size bedrooms. One of them faces north and has a walk-in wardrobe and exit to a patio from where a ladder gives access to the solarium/roof area. Here is where a more accessible terrace with stunning sea views could be developed.<br />The other bedroom has a south facing balcony and sea views. There is a full bathroom servicing this floor.<br />The family home has been regularly maintained and upgraded by the current owners and is in perfect working order, ready to be lived in and enjoyed.

Here you can enjoy peace, space, and the authentic atmosphere of the Andalusian countryside, while still being close to local amenities.<br /><br />Built in 1995, the villa stands on an almost fully fenced, flat plot of no less than 5,267 m². The main house of 112 m² features three comfortable bedrooms, each with its own en-suite bathroom. One of these bedrooms also has a separate entrance from outside, making it ideal for creating an additional guest apartment or rental unit. The living room in the main house is warmed by a cozy wood-burning stove, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere on cooler evenings, and a heating and cooling air conditioning system ensures comfort throughout the year. All bedrooms, as well as the two casitas, are also equipped with air conditioning.<br /><br />Next to the main house are two fully furnished casitas measuring 28 m² and 22 m², perfect for immediate tourist rental. The sale includes the full inventory, meaning you can start renting out immediately without any additional investment.<br /><br />The beautiful garden features a generous swimming pool of nearly 50 m², equipped with a brand-new pump. It is a concrete pool with a liner, so also possible to tile it. Adjacent to the pool, you will find a charming outdoor kitchen and a practical laundry area – everything you need to fully enjoy outdoor living. In front of the house is an enclosed conservatory overlooking the green garden, providing extra living space in every season.<br /><br />The property is surrounded by fifteen different varieties of mature fruit trees, including plum, apple, walnut, cherry, lemon, lime, apricot and mulberry. The kitchen in the main house is equipped with all necessary appliances and offers plenty of space. The spacious living room is the heart of the home and, like the rest of the property, features double glazing. Hot water is supplied via propane gas geysers, except for one bathroom, which uses an electric boiler. The property is connected to the municipal water and electricity network.<br /><br />This unique home not only offers a comfortable and inviting living environment but also excellent opportunities for tourist rental. Everything is already in place – you just need to turn the key.<br /></p>",
