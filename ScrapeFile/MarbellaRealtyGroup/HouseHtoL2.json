    "property_title": "Finca - Cortijo in Pizarra",
    "property_description": "<p>Located in the rich green valleys, nestled comfortably between Alora and Pizarra, this glorious finca looks out seemingly surveying its acres of land that surround.  Skies stretch out as far as the eye can see, meeting with the mountainous horizon visible from every angle.<br /><br />Driving up the lengthy private driveway the size and position of the plot  can truly be appreciated - a plot of 14 hectares has been carefully planted with fig trees that produce incredible fruit and outstanding rentability.  The driveway, which delivers you to the front of the finca, passing the swimming pool on the way, uniquely  continues past the property and down over to the outbuildings farther along, both of which are used as storage facilities. Huge in their own right, these buildings house vehicles such as mini tractors and trailers. These buildings could also serve as garages for family vehicles, being close enough to the main property for easy access.<br /><br />Entering the property by walking across the extensive front terrace, where you can dine alfresco whilst taking in the never ending views, you are welcomed in like an old friend. Both of the living spaces open up on either side as if throwing their arms wide to draw you in. The living area is rich and warm in its colour, plush sofas and seating arrangements. Opposite a dining area stretches elegantly across, offering generous seating at an oval shaped glass table . Both sides are brightly illuminated by tall windows that frame the stunning views and allow vast quantities of natural light to flood in.<br /><br />Through into an open hallway an ornate stairway offers access to the upper floor. A grandiose Wurlitzer from years gone by stands in divergence against the modernity of the sleek grey marble flooring underfoot. Hidden behind an ornate stained glass door is a fully fitted bathroom, mosaic tiled from floor to ceiling in earthy tones and offering a marble corner sink unit and a walk in rain shower.<br />On the opposite side, and also esconded behind a matching stained glass door is a double bedroom, bright and spacious.<br /><br />Moving further into the property a striking and much more grand living space opens up in front of you. This is as dazzling as it is open, bright and airy. Surrounded by vast windows allowing continuous shards of light to filter in and brighten the room from corner to corner, this area is a clever take on a completely new concept in open plan.  The lounging area is furnished in varying shades of white interspersed with silver and black flourishes and a brick surrounded wood burning fireplace offers winter warmth.<br /><br />Adjacent is a dining table seating six, sleek and formal in glass and silver giving the effect of being open and streamlined. Situated next to vast glass windows guests can look out into the courtyard located at the rear of the property, which is open to the heavens above yet kept secure within the four walls.  At the far side,  the kitchen is found which is spacious and bright, with clean cut white fitted units and cupboards, complementing the grey and stainless steel of appliances within.  On one side the windows throw the fantastic countryside view at you whilst on the other side the work top and hatch allow total view thought to the living area. Bar stools offer seating to guests who can either enjoy the chefs company or a hearty breakfast.<br />A further two double bedrooms feature on this floor, both furnished simply yet elegantly, again brightly lit,  and with fitted wardrobes offering plenty of storage.<br /><br />The master bedroom is found on the top floor, secluded and peaceful. A bay window allows light to flood in and irradiate the room whilst pulling your gaze out across to the mountain ranges. Adjacent, the ensuite bathroom completes the privacy whilst the rooftop terrace beckons with an invitation to get even closer to the heavens above. The views from up here stretch over the gardens and off into infinity.<br /><br />The propertys grounds are far reaching, with the immediate vicinity of the finca offering respite from the summer heat in the pool, stylishly surrounded by a tiled terrace and swaying palm trees, featuring loungers, a sofa area and dining area.  A children’s playground offers fun and recreation for those younger visitors.<br /><br />To live here would surely be akin to being at one with nature, in a constant state of discovery at what lies within the property grounds and in the countryside beyond.  They say man is master of his own kingdom - this finca will make you feel exactly that.   From sunrise to sunset you can marvel in the stunning surroundings and exceptional peace,  all from within this abode set against the rolling hills of Pizarra.</p>",

Designed by the acclaimed Francisco Martínez Galván, this four-level residence encompasses an impressive total built area of 674 square meters. The interior offers 503 square meters of meticulously crafted living space, while an additional 171 square meters of terrace ensures a seamless transition between indoor elegance and open-air enjoyment.<br /><br />The arrival experience is nothing short of memorable. Guests and residents are guided directly to the rooftop terrace via a private driveway, establishing a bold entrance that sets the tone for what lies beyond. From the rooftop, expansive views sweep across the carefully manicured fairways of La Resina Golf Course and extend to the shimmering Mediterranean Sea. This vantage point includes thoughtful features such as a Jacuzzi and a pre-installed built-in BBQ area, transforming it into an ideal setting for social gatherings or tranquil sunset moments.<br /><br />Descending into the main living floor reveals a layout designed for fluid movement and connection. The open-plan design integrates spacious living and dining areas, centered around a custom kitchen accented by a striking natural stone island. A side dirty kitchen supports larger entertaining needs without intruding on the clean aesthetics of the main space. Floor-to-ceiling windows welcome an abundance of natural light and create an uninterrupted visual link to the outdoor infinity saltwater pool. Surrounded by mature landscaping and tropical plants, this pool area embodies an atmosphere of privacy and leisure. The main floor also includes an en-suite guest bedroom, providing comfort and accessibility for visitors, while integrated ceiling sound systems and a pre-installed domotic setup ensure the space is ready for modern smart living.<br /><br />The upper level is dedicated to an expansive master suite that redefines private luxury. The suite offers direct access to a generous terrace with panoramic sea views, ideal for morning reflections or evening relaxation. A walk-in wardrobe provides ample space for curated collections, while the marble bathroom invites indulgence with its free-standing soaking tub and carefully selected finishes. An additional en-suite bedroom on this floor mirrors the same high standard of design, offering serene garden views and fostering a restful environment.<br /><br />Potential for further customization exists in the basement level, where future owners may choose to create additional bedrooms, a private gym, a home cinema, or a dedicated spa area, all with direct access to the lush garden. This flexibility allows the home to adapt to evolving lifestyle needs, whether for family expansion, wellness, or entertainment.<br /><br />La Resina Golf is celebrated for its secure, private ambiance and refined architectural style, characterized by a harmonious blend of contemporary lines and natural materials that echo the surrounding landscape. The neighborhood consists mainly of upscale villas and modern homes, creating a cohesive and sophisticated atmosphere that attracts both local and international buyers seeking a high-quality living experience.<br /><br />Residents benefit from excellent proximity to essential amenities and leisure attractions. The International American College is nearby, offering top-tier educational opportunities, while the newly established padel courts at Bossa Café provide dynamic social and fitness options. Local shops, schools, and popular dining spots can be reached within a brief five-minute drive. The sandy beaches and marina, including yacht moorings, are less than ten minutes away, enabling easy access to water sports and seaside relaxation.<br /><br />Estepona is admired for its vibrant beach clubs and traditional chiringuitos like Chiringuito Palm Beach, where one can enjoy fresh seafood and cocktails by the shore. Daily conveniences are further supported by strong connectivity. The A-7 motorway enables smooth travel along the coast, while local bus services and taxi availability ensure that exploring the region is straightforward. The Estepona bus station connects to broader destinations, and Malaga Airport, approximately 45 minutes away, offers frequent international connections, simplifying both business and leisure travel.<br /><br />Villa Three embodies the essence of refined coastal living, combining stunning architecture, practical luxury, and a superb location within one of Estepona’s most desirable golf communities.

There is still room for more. The plantation is a flat area so its much easier to work on them and collect. The main supply for the avocados is water. The finca not only has 500 m long riverside, but also 3 wells. With only one of them there is plenty of water for everything.<br />Furthermore, there are different orange, lemons, olive trees and vineyards.<br />The access is as simple as driving the road from Manilva to Gaucin. It takes just about 25 mins down to the beach, or 30 mins to Guadalmina or Sotogrande.<br />Estimated 5 year ROI over the plantation value, 59%.<br />Estimated f year ROI over the total purchase, 21%.

This palatial style property is located 14 kilometres north of Ronda, Hemingway&apos;s favourite town in Spain, with its famous bridge and bullring, the oldest in the country. The villa is designed and built to the exacting specifications of its owners 10 years ago, and is a reflection of their good taste. Almost 800m2 built. You enter through a typical Andalusian courtyard with large vegetation and a sense of serenity, a fish pond in the centre and different living areas. A hallway runs the length of the central wing of the house, at the end of the hallway is the fully fitted kitchen with top quality appliances, stainless steel cupboards and marble surfaces with direct access to the front patio and gardens with barbecue area, laundry room and utility room. On the opposite side is the dining room of enormous elegance with an 18th century mahogany dining table with French windows overlooking the well maintained lawn and surrounded by a pretty flower bed, a beautiful pergola and barbecue area for alfresco dining. The next room along the hallway is the &quot;little&quot; sitting room, a very relaxing room, with double doors opening onto the outside terrace. The spacious main living room with marble floors comes next with a huge fireplace and a hand-woven Indian carpet which was specially commissioned in Jaipur and took eight months to make. Next is a study or office, at the other end of the hallway is the very elegant and beautifully furnished master suite, with its own sitting room and wonderful views from the French windows that face two sides of the room. Impressive as it is, even more so is its enormous bathroom with bathtub, white marble washbasin and shower. The other four bedrooms are located in this wing of the house, one of them accessed from the hallway, the other three from the front courtyard. All are individually decorated and furnished, but all share the same impeccable quality and size as the other rooms in the house. All have large and attractive en-suite bathrooms. Majestic staircases descend to the terrace immediately below which has been laid out as another area of the formal garden, where fish ponds and tranquil sitting areas are enjoyed. A large part of the hillside of the estate has been cultivated with 1 hectare of vineyards producing really good quality &quot;Reserva&quot; grapes and over two hectares of olive trees. On one of the hillsides above the house, the owners have created a small Mediterranean garden amongst the trees, just another delightful place to discover as you explore this wonderful estate.<br /></p>",

Surrounded by some of the most exclusive urbanizations, this residence is just a few minutes&apos; walk from the beach, upscale amenities, boutique stores, gourmet restaurants, and the iconic Puente Romano Hotel.<br /><br />As you enter the villa, you&apos;re greeted by a welcoming entrance hall that seamlessly flows into a spacious living room. Adjacent is a fully equipped Bulthaup kitchen with state-of-the-art Gaggenau appliances, perfect for culinary enthusiasts. Both the living room and kitchen have direct access to a charming terrace and a beautifully landscaped garden with a pool, creating an idyllic space for relaxation and entertaining.<br /><br />The first floor also includes a guest toilet, a well-appointed bedroom with an en-suite bathroom and dressing room, and the master suite. The master bedroom is a sanctuary, featuring a cozy fireplace, an en-suite bathroom, a large dressing room, and floor-to-ceiling windows that open onto the terrace and garden, filling the space with natural light.<br /><br />The upper floor is dedicated to another luxurious master bedroom, complete with an en-suite bathroom, an expansive dressing room, and access to a private terrace with stunning sea views. From this terrace, you can ascend to the solarium, where panoramic views of the Mediterranean create the perfect backdrop for enjoying the serene surroundings. There is a possibility of extending by 80m2.<br /><br />The plot is exceptionally private, offering unmatched tranquility despite its central location. This unique property is not only ideal for a family home but also presents significant investment potential, thanks to its high profitability in holiday rentals. Moreover, there is an opportunity to expand the villa by approximately 80 m², as the buildability of the plot has not yet been fully utilized.<br /><br />The villa&apos;s location is truly unbeatable, especially as the area is undergoing significant revaluation. The development of four luxury projects nearby, along with recent infrastructure improvements such as new roads, a children&apos;s park, a pedestrian area along the river, and a large parking facility, make this property an exceptional investment in a rapidly appreciating neighborhood.</p>",

Spanning two charming streets — Calle Papuecas and Calle Jesús Cautivo — this striking residence combines timeless elegance with modern comfort, privacy, and an extraordinary sense of space and light rarely found in the old town.<br /><br />Designed to breathe, flow, and glow, Villa Cindy is filled with natural light at every level. From the double-height atrium crowned with a glass ceiling, to the oversized windows and open terraces, every room feels bright, fresh, and beautifully connected to the surrounding architecture and Andalusian sky. Nowhere in the house feels enclosed — instead, you&apos;re immersed in a luminous, airy environment that invites relaxation and refined living.<br /><br />Ground Floor:<br />With entrances from both streets — including a private automated garage — this level offers parking for up to five cars, along with two utility rooms, a fully equipped gym, a Turkish bath, and a shower bathroom. The entrance lobby, flooded with soft natural light, provides access to the elevator and stairs leading to the main living areas.<br /><br />First Floor:<br />A central feature of the home is the dramatic atrium, rising all the way to the glass rooftop and acting as the light-filled core of the villa. A wide glass door opens into a spacious lounge and TV area, dining room, and a designer Schmidt kitchen fitted with top-of-the-line appliances including a Liebherr refrigerator. This entire floor is bathed in daylight, offering seamless flow and openness.<br />Second Floor:<br />A short staircase leads to a guest bathroom, a versatile study or spare bedroom, and a generous guest suite with walk-in wardrobe and ensuite bathroom — each space designed to maintain the home&apos;s fresh, open atmosphere.<br /><br />Third Floor:<br />The first main bedroom suite features its own walk-in wardrobe, ensuite bathroom, and access to a wide passageway with extensive built-in storage. The highlight here is the entertainment terrace, blending covered and open-air spaces and equipped with plasma screen, BBQ, second kitchen, LED lighting, and laundry room. It&apos;s a space made for alfresco living under the sun or stars.<br /><br />Fourth Floor:<br />A second main bedroom suite, also with walk-in wardrobe and ensuite, shares this floor with a bright, open area for additional storage and a sun terrace complete with jacuzzi, outdoor hot/cold shower, and chill-out zone. Glass doors, open sky, and natural breezes make this a true sanctuary.<br /><br />Roof Terrace:<br />Above it all, the rooftop houses the solar panel system which supports electricity and hot water — a modern, sustainable touch that complements the villa’s thoughtful design. The panoramic views across rooftops, mountains, and the sea are simply breathtaking.<br />________________________________________<br />Additional Features:<br />• Full of natural light on every floor<br />• Large double-glazed tilt-and-turn windows<br />• Glass roof flooding the home with daylight<br />• Fresh, aerated interiors with open flow<br />• Ceramic tile floors and granite stairs/kitchen worktops<br />• Fully air-conditioned<br />• Surrounded by the cafés, restaurants, and life of the Old Town<br /><br />Villa Cindy is a light-filled urban sanctuary — a contemporary masterpiece where space, air, and sunlight create a rare lifestyle offering in Estepona. A move-in-ready home for those who appreciate beauty, quality, and the energy of the Old Town — but without compromise.<br /></p>",

Nearby there is a very good facility for tennis and paddle. On the beautiful beaches you can do water sports of various kinds.<br />Los Flamingos is right next to El Paraiso. Here is a par 64 executive course with an American golf academy. It also boasts the five-star Villa Padierna Hotel and spa. The hotel has recently been named one of the 30 leading hotels in the world.<br />All facilities are available at the commercial center nearby, such as restaurants, supermarkets, bank, travel agency and a variety of other professional services.<br /><br />To conclude, a visit is highly recommended, since seeing is believing, because this is truly a wonderful property on the Costa del Sol, perfect for you and your family.<br />3D walk through and a video is available.<br />The villa has a tourist license.</p>",

It has the original configuration of the villas, with one bedroom and ensuite bathroom on the ground floor, and 3 bedrooms each with it&apos;s own bathroom on the first floor.<br />The ground floor boasts a stunning open plan living area, Through the impressive wooden front door which is both wide and tall, one enters the living room area, where the immediate impact of space and light create the feeling for this fabulous la Cala Golf villa.
