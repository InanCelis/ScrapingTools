From here we go up to the first floor where we have four double bedrooms, a bathroom, and enough space to build a second bathroom. On the upper floor, which needs some improvements, we find four more living rooms or bedrooms, and another bathroom, which has been renovated. From here we climb to the highest part, with a fully restored terrace and roof, offering spectacular views of the Sierra de las Nieves and the awakening of the bells of the San Miguel church.

    "property_description": "<p>Tucked into the serene Andalusian countryside, this beautifully presented traditional country home offers the perfect blend of rustic charm and modern comfort. With spectacular panoramic views and some of the most breathtaking sunsets imaginable, the property is ideally situated just off a tarmac road, a short 1.3 km from the charming hamlet of Pastelero. There you’ll find two popular restaurants and a bakery with daily essentials – an easy stroll away if you&apos;re up for a walk back uphill.<br />This versatile property has been thoughtfully adapted to accommodate a variety of lifestyles. Whether you’re seeking a spacious multi-generational family home, a retreat for visiting friends, or an income-generating tourist accommodation, the flexible layout and self-contained living spaces make almost anything possible. In total, there are six bedrooms, five bathrooms and two kitchens, creating distinct areas that can function entirely independently. It’s a dream opportunity for anyone interested in rural tourism or simply in need of space and privacy.<br />The main residence consists of three bedrooms and two bathrooms, with a warm, inviting feel throughout. The heart of the home is the country style kitchen, fully fitted with quality hardwood cabinetry, granite worktops, and a large gas stove with oven. There’s a generous dining room with space for eight, a cozy sitting room with wood-burning stove, and charming traditional features throughout. All major rooms are equipped with air conditioning, and the house is connected to mains water and electricity, with broadband internet and a modern 3-chamber septic tank.<br />The home’s annex, seamlessly connected to the main house yet entirely private, offers a large double bedroom, living/dining room with wood burner (now in use as a bedroom), new bathroom and an extra bathroom area that needs some renovation. There is a west-facing terrace with uninterrupted views – perfect for evening relaxation. With its own entrance and a lockable internal door to the main home, this annex is ideal for family or guests seeking independence or could easily be rented out for tourism.<br />Beneath the main house lies another fully self-contained one-bedroom apartment with its own kitchen, living and dining space, shower room, and direct access to a private terrace with lush countryside views.<br />The property includes a range of useful outbuildings: storage sheds, a wood store, and a utility room. There&apos;s ample parking space, including a concrete base ideal for a camper van or trailer. A rare loft space provides even more storage, ideal for seasonal items. There is also an above ground swimming pool, ideal for staying cool during the summer months.<br />The plot of 1,500m² features lovingly maintained gardens filled with mature trees and shrubs. A large, gated courtyard connects the main living spaces and outbuildings, offering the ideal setting for alfresco dining or lounging. One of the property’s most unique features is the preserved Era – a traditional threshing circle – now serving as a dramatic space for laundry drying with one of the best views in the region.<br />Located just 10 minutes from the thriving village of Villanueva de la Concepción, the home offers easy access to a range of services including supermarkets, restaurants, a 24-hour health centre, schools, sports facilities, and a public swimming pool. El Torcal Natural Park and El Chorro’s famous Caminito del Rey are nearby, offering unparalleled hiking and natural beauty.<br />This is a rare opportunity to own a beautifully maintained, flexible home in a sought-after rural location that offers income potential, tranquility, and authentic Andalusian charm. This is more than a home – it&apos;s a lifestyle waiting to be embraced.</p>",

Accessed via a private staircase from the street, this bright and modern home provides a versatile layout ideal for a single resident, a couple, or an investor seeking rental returns.<br /><br />The interior space of 75m² includes an open-plan kitchen and living area, two sky lights let in natural light and there are two additional rooms at the front—both with double-glazed windows—currently planned as bedrooms. These could easily be repurposed into a TV lounge, home office, or dining area, or even combined into one larger living space to better suit your lifestyle.<br /><br />To the rear, the master bedroom features a spacious and stylish en-suite, complete with a freestanding bathtub, walk-in shower, and generous proportions. An additional bathroom adds functionality for guests or shared use.<br /><br />Upstairs, the standout feature is the expansive roof solarium (77m²)—fully equipped with electricity and water connectivity, in-built outdoor space for a kitchen, and offering breathtaking views of the sea, mountains, and iconic white village rooftops. This outdoor space is larger than the apartment itself and opens endless possibilities for entertaining, relaxing, or even creating a rooftop garden oasis.<br /><br />Interior: 75m²<br />Roof Terrace: 77m²<br />Total Build: 92m²<br />Price: €375,000<br /><br />A low-maintenance home, a holiday village escape, or a smart investment property with potential for holiday or long-term rental income.<br /><br /></p>",
