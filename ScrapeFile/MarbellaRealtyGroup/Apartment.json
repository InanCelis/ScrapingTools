The bedroom has a Juliette balcony which is West facing and overlooks a beautiful quiet street below. The bedroom is bright and has lovely original ceramic flooring and has a large walk in wardrobe.<br /><br />The property has potential to be reconfigured to be 1 large open plan unit which would flood the property with natural light and give the property a more spacious modern feeling. In addition there is the potential to construct another mezzanine floor on the roof subject to project. A very interesting property indeed.<br /><br />The property has a tourist license in place and would work very well as a holiday rental due to its amazing central location. The property has no issues to change ownership of tourist license because it is not in a community.<br /><br />Modern images created to show how it could look with some cosmetic updating<br /><br /></p>",

Fibre broadband and a satellite-ready TV point are already in place.<br /><br />Slide the doors aside and the sitting room spills onto a south-facing terrace big enough for sunset suppers or morning yoga.
