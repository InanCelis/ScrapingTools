Inspired by Venetian church architecture, it combines timeless European elegance with relaxed coastal living. Set on a generous 933 square metre plot, the four-bedroom, four-bathroom home—including two en-suites—is spread across three levels, offering a unique blend of style, comfort, and space. A grand entrance welcomes you with elegant pillars, arched doorways, and polished marble floors that run throughout the house, setting the tone for what’s to come.<br /><br />A glass balustrade staircase leads to the upper floors, where a domed ceiling casts soft natural light across the hallway. Each bedroom has floor-to-ceiling windows that flood the rooms with light, thanks to the southeast-facing orientation. The master suite is a peaceful retreat with a large walk-in dressing room featuring a central island, and a Juliet balcony that overlooks the private pool. On the lower level, there’s a flexible extra room that could serve as a gym, cinema room, or a private guest apartment, giving you the ability to customise the home, to suit your lifestyle.<br /><br />In the main living room, a grand open fireplace creates a cosy and inviting atmosphere. Step outside, and the space becomes even more special. The garden is surrounded by tall palm trees, providing privacy and a true sense of escape. The centrepiece of the garden is the private pool. It features four gentle waterfalls, creating a calming, almost spa-like feel. Along one side of the villa, a fishlake adds to the peaceful setting, and beside it, a terrace with an open wood-burning barbecue under arched stonework is perfect for outdoor meals or entertaining. On the far end of the garden, an old property was removed to extend the garden, adding to the villa’s sense of space and privacy.<br /><br />Every corner of this home has been carefully designed, blending classic details with modern touches to create a warm and impressive living space. This is more than just a villa near the beach—it is a celebration of art, architecture, and understated opulence.</p>",
